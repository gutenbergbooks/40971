<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>When a foreigner visits certain countries, as England, Scotland, or
America, he is sometimes presented with the rights of citizenship. Such
has been the privilege of the "History of the Reformation of the Sixteenth
Century." From 150,000 to 200,000 copies are in circulation, in the English
language, in the countries I have just mentioned; while in France
the number hardly exceeds 4000. This is a real adoption,&mdash;naturalizing
this Work in the countries that have received it with so much favour.</p>

<p>I accept this honour. Accordingly, while the former Volumes of my
History were originally published in France; now that, after a lapse of five
years, I think of issuing a continuation of it, I do so in Great Britain.</p>

<p>This is not the only change in the mode of publication. I did not think
it right to leave to translators, as in the cases of the former Volumes, the
task of expressing my ideas in English. The best translations are always
faulty; and the Author alone can have the certainty of conveying his idea,
his whole idea, and nothing but his idea. Without overlooking the merit
that the several existing translations may possess, even the best of them is
not free from inaccuracies, more or less important. Of these I have given
specimens in the Preface to the New Translation of the former Volumes by
Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>, which has been revised by me, and which will shortly be published
by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Oliver</span> and <span class="smcap">Boyd</span>. These inaccuracies, no doubt most
involuntary, contributed in giving rise to a very severe contest that took
place in America, on the subject of this Work, between the Episcopalians
and the Baptists on the one hand, and the Presbyterians on the other,&mdash;a
contest that I hope is now terminated, but in which (as a New York correspondent
informed me) one of the most beneficial and powerful Christian
Societies of the United States had been on the brink of dissolution.</p>

<p>With such facts before me, I could no longer hesitate. It became necessary
for me to publish, myself, in English; and this I accordingly do.
But although that language is familiar to me, I was desirous of securing,
to a certain extent, the co-operation of an English literary gentleman.
Dr. <span class="smcap">Henry White</span>, a Graduate of Cambridge, and Member of a Continental
University, has had the great kindness to visit Switzerland for this
purpose, although such a step exposed him to much inconvenience, and to
pass with me at Geneva the time necessary for this labour. I could not
have had a more enlightened coadjutor; and I here express my obligations
to him for his very able assistance.</p>

<p>I therefore publish in English this Continuation of the History of the
Reformation. I do not think that, as I publish, myself, in this language,
any one will have the power, or will entertain the idea, of attempting
another publication. It would be a very bad speculation on the part of
any bookseller; for where is the reader that would not prefer the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
text, as published by the Author himself, to a translation made by a
stranger?</p>

<p>But there is a higher question&mdash;a question of morality. Of all property
that a man can possess, there is none so essentially his own as the labours
of his mind. Man acquires the fruits of his fields by the sweat of his servants
and of his beasts of burden; and the produce of his manufactures
by the labour of his workmen and the movement of his machines; but it
is by his own toils, by the exercise of his most exalted faculties, that he
creates the productions of his mind. Accordingly, in putting this History
under the protection of the laws, I place it at the same time under a no
less secure safeguard,&mdash;that of justice. I know that it is written in the
consciences on the other side of the Channel and of the Atlantic: <i>Ye shall
have one manner of law, as well for the stranger as for one of your own
country: for I am the Lord your God.</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> To English honour I confide this
Work.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The first two Books of this Volume contain the most important epochs
of the Reformation&mdash;the Protest of Spire, and the Confession of Augsburg.
The last two describe the establishment of the Reform in most of the Swiss
cantons, and the instructive and deplorable events that are connected with
the catastrophe of Cappel.</p>

<p>It was my desire to narrate also the beginnings of the English Reformation;
but my Volume is filled, and I am compelled to defer this subject to
the next. It is true I might have omitted some matters here treated of,
but I had strong reasons for doing the contrary. The Reformation in
Great Britain is not very important before the period described in this
volume; the order of time compelled me, therefore, to remain on the Continent;
for whatever may be the historian's desire, he cannot change dates
and the order that God has assigned to the events of the world. Besides,
before turning more especially towards England, Scotland, France, and
other countries, I determined on bringing the Reformation of Germany and
German Switzerland to the decisive epochs of 1530 and 1531. The History
of the Reformation, properly so called, is then, in my opinion, almost
complete in those countries. The work of Faith has there attained its
apogee: that of conferences, of interims, of diplomacy begins. I do not,
however, entirely abandon Germany and German Switzerland, but henceforward
they will occupy me less: the movement of the sixteenth century
has there made its effort. I said, from the very first: It is the History of
the Reformation and not of Protestantism that I am relating.</p>

<p>It is not, however, without some portion of fear that I approach the History
of the Reformation in England; it is perhaps more difficult than elsewhere.
I have received communications from some of the most respectable
men of the different ecclesiastical parties, who, each feeling convinced that
their own point of view is the true one, desire me to present the history
in this light. I hope to execute my task with impartiality and truth. But
I thought it would be advantageous to study for some time longer the principles
and the facts. I am at present occupied in this task, and shall consecrate
to it, with God's assistance, the first part of my next Volume.</p>

<p>Should it be thought that I might have described the Reformation in
Switzerland with greater brevity, I beg my readers will call to mind that,
independently of the intrinsic importance of this history, Switzerland is
the Author's birthplace.</p>

<p>I had at first thought of making arrangements for the present publication
with the English and Scotch booksellers who had translated the former
portions. Relations that I had maintained with some of these publishers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
and which had gained my esteem for them, induced me to adopt this course.
They were consequently informed by letter of my purpose, and several
months later I had an interview with some of them at Glasgow. I told
them of my intentions, and desired to know theirs. They replied, that
they could not communicate them immediately, since they would first have
to come to an arrangement with their colleagues, in order to make me a
proposal in common. It would appear that they did not succeed. However
that may be, and although I allowed a sufficient period of time to
elapse, I received no communication from the associated publishers. But
at the same time, one of the first houses in Great Britain, Messrs. <span class="smcap">Oliver</span>
and <span class="smcap">Boyd</span> of Edinburgh, who were introduced to me by my highly respected
friend Dr. <span class="smcap">Chalmers</span>, made me a suitable and precise offer. I
could wait no longer; and on the very eve of my departure from London
for the Continent, after a sojourn of three months in Scotland and in
England, I made arrangements with them, which have since been definitively
settled, and the Work is now their property.</p>

<p>The French laws are positive to protect literary property in France, even
if it belongs to a foreigner. I am less familiar with the English laws; but
I will not do England the injustice of believing that its legislation is surpassed
by that of France in justice and in morality.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>BOOK XIII.</h2>

<h3>THE PROTEST AND THE CONFERENCE. 1526-1529.</h3>


<p>I. We have witnessed the commencement, the struggles,
the reverses, and the progress of the Reformation; but the
conflicts that we have hitherto described have been but partial;
we are entering upon a new period,&mdash;that of general
battles. Spire (1529) and Augsburg (1530) are two names
that shine forth with more immortal glory than Marathon,
Pavia, or Marengo. Forces that up to the present time were
separate, are now uniting into one energetic band; and the
power of God is working in these brilliant actions, which
open a new era in the history of nations, and communicate
an irresistible impulse to mankind. The passage from the
middle ages to modern times has arrived.</p>

<p>A great protest is about to be accomplished; and although
there have been protestants in the Church from the very beginning
of Christianity, since liberty and truth could not be
maintained here below, save by protesting continually against
despotism and error, Protestantism is about to take a new step.
It is about to become a body, and thus attack with greater energy
that "mystery of iniquity" which for ages has taken a
bodily shape at Rome, in the very temple of God.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">TWOFOLD MOVEMENT OF REFORM.</div>

<p>But although we have to treat of protests, it must not however
be imagined that the Reformation is a negative work.
In every sphere in which anything great is evolved, whether
in nature or society, there is a principle of life at work,&mdash;a
seed that God fertilizes. The Reformation, when it appeared
in the sixteenth century, did not, it is true, perform a new
work, for a reformation is not a formation; but it turned its
face toward the beginnings of Christianity, thither were its
steps directed; it seized upon them with adoration, and embraced
them with affection. Yet it was not satisfied with this
return to primitive times. Laden with its precious burden, it
again crossed the interval of ages, and brought back to fallen
and lifeless Christendom the sacred fire that was destined to
restore it to light and life. In this twofold movement consisted
its action and its strength. Afterwards, no doubt, it rejected
superannuated forms, and combated error; but this was,
so to speak, only the least of its works, and its third movement.
Even the protest of which we have to speak had for its end
and aim the re-establishment of truth and of life, and was essentially
a positive act.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REFORM THE WORK OF GOD.</div>

<p>This powerful and rapid twofold action of reform, by which
the apostolic times were re-established at the opening of modern
history, proceeded not from man. A reformation is not
arbitrarily made, as charters and revolutions are in some countries.
A real reformation, prepared during many ages, is the
work of the Spirit of God. Before the appointed hour, the
greatest geniuses and even the most faithful of God's servants
cannot produce it; but when the reforming time is come,
when it is God's pleasure to intervene in the affairs of the
world, the divine life must clear a passage, and it is able to
create of itself the humble instruments by which this life is
communicated to the human race. Then, if men are silent,
the very stones will cry out.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>It is to the protest of Spire (1529) that we are now about
to turn our eyes; but the way to this protest was prepared by
years of peace, and followed by attempts at concord that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
shall have also to describe. Nevertheless the formal establishment
of Protestantism remains the great fact that prevails in
the history of the Reformation from 1526 to 1529.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The Duke of Brunswick had brought into Germany the
threatening message of Charles the Fifth. The Emperor was
about to repair from Spain to Rome to come to an understanding
with the Pope, and from thence to pass into Germany
to constrain the heretics. The last summons was to be addressed
to them by the Diet of Spire, 1526.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The decisive
hour for the Reformation was about to strike.</p>

<p>On the 25th June, 1526, the diet opened. In the instructions,
dated at Seville, 23d March, the Emperor ordered that
the Church customs should be maintained entire, and called
upon the diet to punish those who refused to carry out the
edict of Worms,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Ferdinand himself was at Spire, and his
presence rendered these orders more formidable. Never had
the hostility which the Romish partisans entertained against
the evangelical princes, appeared in so striking a manner.
"The Pharisees," said Spalatin, "pursue Jesus Christ with
violent hatred."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PALLADIUM OF REFORM.</div>

<p>Never also had the evangelical princes showed so much
hope. Instead of presenting themselves frightened and trembling,
like guilty men, they were seen advancing, surrounded
by the ministers of the Word, with uplifted heads and cheerful
looks. Their first step was to ask for a place of worship.
The Bishop of Spire, count-palatine of the Rhine, having indignantly
refused this strange request,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the princes complained
of it as of an injustice, and ordered their ministers to
preach daily in the halls of their palaces. An immense crowd
from the city and the country, which amounted to many thousands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
immediately filled them.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In vain on the feast days did
Ferdinand, the ultra-montane princes, and the bishops assist
in the pomps of the Roman worship in the beautiful cathedral
of Spire; the unadorned Word of God, preached in the
Protestant vestibules, engrossed the hearers, and the Mass was
celebrated in an empty church.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>It was not only the ministers, but the knights and the
grooms, "mere idiots," who, unable to control their zeal, everywhere
extolled the Word of the Lord.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> All the followers of
the evangelical princes wore these letters braided on their right
sleeves: V. D. M. I. Æ., that is to say, "The word of the
Lord endureth for ever."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The same inscription might be
read on the escutcheons of the princes, suspended over their
hotels. The Word of God&mdash;such from this moment was the
palladium of the Reform.</p>

<p>This was not all. The Protestants knew that the mere
worship was not sufficient: the Landgrave had therefore called
upon the Elector to abolish certain "court customs" which dishonoured
the Gospel. These two princes had consequently
drawn up an order of living which forbade drunkenness, debauchery,
and other vicious customs prevalent during a diet.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">FIRMNESS OF THE REFORMERS.</div>

<p>Perhaps the Protestant princes sometimes put forward their
dissent beyond what prudence would have required. Not
only they did not go to Mass, and did not observe the prescribed
fasts, but still further, on the meagre days, their attendants
were seen publicly bearing dishes of meat and game,
destined for their masters' tables, and crossing, says Cochl&oelig;us,
in the presence of the whole auditory, the halls in which the
worship was celebrating. "It was," says this writer, "with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the intent of attracting the Catholics by the savour of the meats
and of the wines."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The Elector in effect had a numerous court: seven hundred
persons formed his retinue. One day he gave a banquet
at which twenty-six princes with their gentlemen and councillors
were present. They continued playing until a very
late hour&mdash;ten at night. Everything in Duke John announced
the most powerful prince of the empire. The youthful
Landgrave of Hesse, full of zeal and knowledge, and in
the strength of a first Christian love, made a still deeper impression
on those who approached him. He would frequently
dispute with the bishops, and thanks to his acquaintance with
the Holy Scriptures, he easily stopped their mouths.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>This firmness in the friends of the Reformation produced
fruits that surpassed their expectation. It was no longer possible
to be deceived: the spirit that was manifested in these
men was the spirit of the Bible. Everywhere the sceptre was
falling from the hands of Rome. "The leaven of Luther,"
said a zealous Papist, "sets all the people of Germany in a
ferment, and foreign nations themselves are agitated by formidable
movements."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>It was immediately seen how great is the strength of deep
convictions. The states that were well disposed towards the
Reform, but which had not ventured to give their adhesion
publicly, became emboldened. The neutral states, which demanded
the repose of the empire, formed the resolution of opposing
the edict of Worms, the execution of which would
have spread trouble through all Germany, and the Papist
states lost their boldness. The bow of the mighty was broken.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PROCEEDINGS OF THE DIET.</div>

<p>Ferdinand did not think proper, at so critical a moment, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
communicate to the diet the severe instructions he had received
from Seville.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> He substituted a proposition of a nature
to satisfy both parties.</p>

<p>The laymen immediately recovered the influence of which
the clergy had dispossessed them. The ecclesiastics resisted
a proposal in the college of princes that the diet should occupy
itself with church abuses, but their exertions were unavailing.
Undoubtedly a non-political assembly would have been preferable
to the diet, but it was already something that religious
matters were no longer to be regulated solely by the priests.</p>

<p>The deputies from the cities having received communication
of this resolution, called for the abolition of every
usage contrary to the faith in Jesus Christ. In vain did the
bishops exclaim that, instead of abolishing pretended abuses,
they would do much better to burn all the books with which
Germany had been inundated during the last eight years.
"You desire," was the reply, "to bury all wisdom and knowledge."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
The request of the cities was agreed to,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and the
diet was divided into committees for the abolition of abuses.</p>

<p>Then was manifested the profound disgust inspired by the
priests of Rome. "The clergy," said the deputy from
Frankfort, "make a jest of the public good, and look after
their own interests only." "The laymen," said the deputy
from Duke George, "have the salvation of Christendom much
more at heart than the clergy."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PAPACY DESCRIBED.</div>

<p>The commissions made their report: people were astonished
at it. Never had men spoken out so freely against the pope
and the bishops. The commission of the princes, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the ecclesiastics and the laymen were in equal numbers, proposed
a fusion of Popery and Reform. "The Priests would
do better to marry," said they, "than to keep women of ill-fame
in their houses; every man should be at liberty to
communicate under one or both forms; German and Latin
may be equally employed in the Lord's Supper and in
Baptism; as for the other sacraments, let them be preserved,
but let them be administered gratuitously. Finally, let the
Word of God be preached according to the interpretation of
the Church (this was the demand of Rome), but always explaining
Scripture by Scripture" (this was the great principle
of the Reformation). Thus the first step was taken towards
a national union. Still a few more efforts, and the whole
German race would be walking in the direction of the Gospel.</p>

<p>The evangelical Christians, at the sight of this glorious
prospect, redoubled their exertions. "Stand fast in the doctrine,"
said the Elector of Saxony to his councillors.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> At the
same time hawkers in every part of the city were selling
Christian pamphlets, short and easy to read, written in Latin
and in German, and ornamented with engravings, in which
the errors of Rome were vigorously attacked.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> One of
these books was entitled, <i>The Papacy with its Members painted
and described by Doctor Luther</i>. In it figured the pope, the cardinal,
and then all the religious orders, exceeding sixty, each
with their costumes and description in verse. Under the picture
of one of these orders were the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Greedy priests, see, roll in gold<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Forgetful of the humble Jesu:<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>under another:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We forbid you to behold<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Bible, lest it should mislead you!<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a><br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></div></div>

<p>and under a third:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We can fast and pray the harder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With an overflowing larder.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Not one of these orders," said Luther to the reader, "thinks
either of faith or charity. This one wears the tonsure, the
other a hood; this a cloak, that a robe. One is white,
another black, a third gray, and a fourth blue. Here is one
holding a looking-glass, there one with a pair of scissors.
Each has his playthings......Ah! these are the palmer worms,
the locusts, the canker-worms, and the caterpillars which, as
Joel saith, have eaten up all the earth."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM.</div>

<p>But if Luther employed the scourges of sarcasm, he also
blew the trumpet of the prophets; and this he did in a work
entitled <i>The Destruction of Jerusalem</i>. Shedding tears like
Jeremiah, he denounced to the German people a ruin like that
of the Holy City, if like it they rejected the Gospel.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> "God
has imparted to us all his treasures," exclaimed he; "he became
man, he has served us,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> he died for us, he has risen
again, and he has so opened the gates of heaven, that all may
enter......The hour of grace is come......The glad tidings
are proclaimed......But where is the city, where is the
prince that has received them? They insult the Gospel:
they draw the sword, and daringly seize God by the beard.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>......But
wait......He will turn round; with one blow will
he break their jaws, and all Germany will be but one wide
ruin."</p>

<p>These works had a very great sale.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> It was not only the
peasants and townspeople who read them, but nobles also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and princes. Leaving the priests alone at the foot of the altar,
they threw themselves into the arms of the new Gospel.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
The necessity of a reform of abuses was proclaimed on the 1st
of August by a general committee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE INSTRUCTIONS OF SEVILLE.</div>

<p>Then Rome, which had appeared to slumber, awoke.
Fanatical priests, monks, ecclesiastical princes, all beset Ferdinand.
Cunning, bribery, nothing was spared. Did not Ferdinand
possess the instructions of Seville? To refuse their
publication was to effect the ruin of the Church and of the
empire. Let the voice of Charles oppose its powerful <i>veto</i> to
the dizziness that is hurrying Germany along, said they, and
Germany will be saved! Ferdinand made up his mind, and
at length, on the 3d August, published the decree, drawn up
more than four months previously in favour of the edict of
Worms.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The persecution was about to begin; the reformers would
be thrown into dungeons, and the sword drawn on the banks
of the Guadalquivir would pierce at last the bosom of Reform.</p>

<p>The effect of the imperial ordinance was immense. The
breaking of an axle-tree does not more violently check the
velocity of a railway train. The Elector and the Landgrave
announced that they were about to quit the diet, and ordered
their attendants to prepare for their departure. At the same
time the deputies from the cities drew towards these two
princes, and the Reformation appeared on the brink of entering
immediately upon a contest with the Pope and Charles
the Fifth.</p>

<p>But it was not yet prepared for a general struggle. It was
necessary for the tree to send out its roots deeper, before the
Almighty unchained the stormy winds against it. A spirit
of blindness, similar to that which in former times was sent
out upon Saul and Herod,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> then seized upon the great enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of the Gospel; and thus was it that Divine Providence
saved the reform in its cradle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHANGE OF POLICY.</div>

<p>The first movement of trouble was over. The friends of
the Gospel began to consider the date of the imperial instructions,
and to weigh the new political combinations which
seemed to announce to the world the most unlooked-for events.
"When the Emperor wrote these letters," said the cities of
Upper Germany, "he was on good terms with the Pope, but
now everything is changed. It is even asserted that he had
told Margaret, his deputy in the Low Countries, to proceed
<i>gently</i> with respect to the Gospel. Let us send him a deputation."
That was not necessary. Charles had not waited
until now to form a different resolution. The course of public
affairs, taking a sudden turn, had rushed into an entirely
new path. Years of peace were about to be granted to the
Reform.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RELIGIOUS LIBERTY PROPOSED.</div>

<p>Clement VII., whom Charles was about to visit, according
to the instructions of Seville, in order to receive in Rome
itself and from his sacred hands the imperial crown, and in return
to give up to the pontiff the Gospel and the Reformation,&mdash;Clement
VII, seized with a strange infatuation, had
suddenly turned against this powerful monarch. The Emperor,
unwilling to favour his ambition in every point, had
opposed his claims on the states of the Duke of Ferrara.
Clement immediately became exasperated, and cried out that
Charles wished to enslave the peninsula, but that the time
was come for re-establishing the independence of Italy. This
great idea of Italian independence, entertained at that period
by a few literary men, had not, as now, penetrated the mass
of the nation. Clement therefore hastened to have recourse
to political combinations. The Pope, the Venetians, and the
King of France, who had scarcely recovered his liberty, formed
a <i>holy league</i>, of which the King of England was by a bull
proclaimed the preserver and protector.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> In June 1526, the
Emperor caused the most favourable propositions to be presented
to the Pope; but these advances were ineffectual, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the Duke of Sessa, Charles's ambassador at Rome, returning on
horseback from his last audience, placed a court-fool behind
him, who, by a thousand monkey tricks, gave the Roman people
to understand how they laughed at the projects of the Pope.
The latter responded to these bravadoes by a brief, in which he
threatened the Emperor with excommunication, and without
loss of time pushed his troops into Lombardy, whilst Milan,
Florence, and Piedmont declared for the Holy League. Thus
was Europe preparing to be avenged for the triumph of
Pavia.</p>

<p>Charles did not hesitate. He wheeled to the right as
quickly as the Pope had done to the left, and turned abruptly
towards the evangelical princes. "Let us suspend the Edict
of Worms," wrote he to his brother; "let us bring back Luther's
partisans by mildness, and by a good council cause
the evangelical truth to triumph." At the same time he demanded
that the Elector, the Landgrave, and their allies
should march with him against the Turks&mdash;or against Italy,
for the common good of Christendom.</p>

<p>Ferdinand hesitated. To gain the friendship of the Lutherans
was to forfeit that of the other princes. The latter
were already beginning to utter violent threats.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The Protestants
themselves were not very eager to grasp the Emperor's
hand. "It is God, God himself, who will save his churches."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>What was to be done? The edict of Worms could neither
be repealed nor carried into execution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CRISIS OF THE REFORMATION.</div>

<p>This strange situation led of necessity to the desired solution:
religious liberty. The first idea of this occurred to the
deputies of the cities. "In one place," said they, "the ancient
ceremonies have been preserved; in another they have been
abolished; and both think they are right. Let us allow each
one to do as he thinks fit, until a council shall re-establish the
desired unity by the Word of God." This idea gained favour,
and the <i>recess</i> of the diet, dated the 27th August, decreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
that a universal, or at least a national free council should be
convoked within a year, that they should request the Emperor
to return speedily to Germany, and that, until then, each state
should behave in its own territory in a manner so as to be
able to render an account to God and to the Emperor.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Thus they escaped from their difficulty by a middle course;
and this time it was really the true one. Each one maintained
his rights, while recognising another's. The diet of
1526 forms an important epoch in history: an ancient power,
that of the middle ages, is shaken; a new power, that of modern
times, is advancing; religious liberty boldly takes its
stand in front of Romish despotism; a lay spirit prevails over
the sacerdotal spirit. In this single step there is a complete
victory: the cause of the Reform is won.</p>

<p>Yet it was little suspected. Luther, on the morrow of the
day on which the <i>recess</i> was published, wrote to a friend:
"The diet is sitting at Spire in the German fashion. They
drink and gamble, and there is nothing done except that."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
"Le congrès danse et ne marche pas,"<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> has been said in our
days. It is because great things are often transacted under
an appearance of frivolity, and because God accomplishes his
designs unknown even to those whom he employs as his instruments.
In this diet a gravity and love of liberty of conscience
were manifested, which are the fruits of Christianity,
and which in the sixteenth century had its earliest, if not its
most energetic development among the German nations.</p>

<p>Yet Ferdinand still hesitated. Mahomet himself came
to the aid of the Gospel. Louis, king of Hungary and Bohemia,
drowned at Mohacz on the 29th August, 1526, as he
was fleeing from before Soliman II., had bequeathed the crown
of these two kingdoms to Ferdinand. But the Duke of
Bavaria, the Waywode of Transylvania, and, above all, the
terrible Soliman, contested it against him. This was sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to occupy Charles's brother: he left Luther, and hastened
to dispute the two thrones.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<div class="sidenote">ITALIAN WAR.</div>

<p>II. The Emperor immediately reaped the fruits of his new
policy. No longer having his hands tied by Germany, he
turned them against Rome. The Reformation had been exalted
and the Papacy was to be abased. The blows aimed at
its pitiless enemy were about to open a new career to the
evangelical work.</p>

<p>Ferdinand, who was detained by his Hungarian affairs,
gave the charge of the Italian expedition to Freundsberg,
that old general who had patted Luther in a friendly manner
on the shoulder as the reformer was about to appear before
the diet of Worms.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> This veteran, observed a contemporary,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
who "bore in his chivalrous heart God's holy Gospel,
well fortified and flanked by a strong wall," pledged his
wife's jewels, sent recruiting parties into all the towns of
Upper Germany, and owing to the magic idea of a war
against the Pope, soon witnessed crowds of soldiers flocking
to his standard. "Announce," Charles had said to his brother,&mdash;"announce
that the army is to march against the Turks;
every one will know what Turks are meant."</p>

<p>Thus the mighty Charles, instead of marching with the
Pope against the Reform, as he had threatened at Seville,
marches with the Reform against the Pope. A few days
had sufficed to produce this change of direction: there are
few such in history in which the hand of God is more
plainly manifested. Charles immediately assumed all the
airs of a reformer. On the 17th September, he addressed a
manifesto to the Pope,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> in which he reproaches him for
behaving not like the father of the faithful, but like an insolent
and haughty man;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and declares his astonishment that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
being Christ's vicar, he should dare to shed blood to acquire
earthly possessions, "which," added he, "is quite contrary to
the evangelical doctrine."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Luther could not have spoken
better. "Let your holiness," continued Charles the Fifth,
"return the sword of St. Peter into the scabbard, and convoke
a holy and universal council." But the sword was much
more to the pontiff's taste than the council. Is not the
Papacy, according to the Romish doctors, the source of the
two powers? Can it not depose kings, and consequently
fight against them?<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Charles prepared to requite "eye for
eye, and tooth for tooth."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ITALIAN CAMPAIGN.</div>

<p>Now began that terrible campaign during which the storm
burst on Rome and on the Papacy that had been destined to
fall on Germany and the Gospel. By the violence of the
blows inflicted on the pontifical city, we may judge of the
severity of those that would have dashed in pieces the reformed
churches. While we retrace so many scenes of horror,
we have constant need of calling to mind that the chastisement
of the seven-hilled city had been predicted by the Divine
Scriptures.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MARCH ON ROME.</div>

<p>In the month of November, Freundsberg, at the head of
fifteen thousand men, was at the foot of the Alps. The old
general, avoiding the military roads, that were well guarded
by the enemy, flung himself into a narrow path, over frightful
precipices, that a few blows of the mattock would have
rendered impassable. The soldiers are forbidden to look behind
them; nevertheless their heads turn, their feet slip, and
horse and foot fall from time to time down the abyss. In the
most difficult passes, the most sure-footed of the infantry lower
their long pikes to the right and left of their aged chief, by
way of barrier, and Freundsberg advances, clinging to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
lansquenet in front, and pushed on by the one behind. In
three days the Alps are crossed, and on the 19th November
the army reaches the territory of Brescia.</p>

<p>The Constable of Bourbon, who since the death of Pescara
was commander-in-chief of the imperial army, had just taken
possession of the duchy of Milan. The Emperor having promised
him this conquest for a recompense, Bourbon was compelled
to remain there some time to consolidate his power.
At length, on the 12th February, he and his Spanish troops
joined the army of Freundsberg, which was becoming impatient
at his delays. The Constable had many men, but no
money: he resolved therefore to follow the advice of the
Duke of Ferrara, that inveterate enemy of the princes of the
Church, and proceed straight to Rome.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The whole army
received this news with a shout of joy. The Spaniards were
filled with a desire of avenging Charles the Fifth, and the
Germans were overflowing with hatred against the Pope: all
exulted in the hope of receiving their pay and of having their
labours richly recompensed at last by the treasures of Christendom
that Rome had been accumulating for ages. Their
shouts re-echoed beyond the Alps. Every man in Germany
thought that the last hour of the Papacy had now come, and
prepared to contemplate its fall. "The Emperor's forces are
triumphing in Italy," wrote Luther; "the Pope is visited from
every quarter. His destruction draweth nigh; his hour and
his end are come."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">REVOLT OF THE TROOPS.</div>

<p>A few slight advantages gained by the papal soldiers in the
kingdom of Naples, led to the conclusion of a truce that was
to be ratified by the Pope and by the Emperor. At this
news a frightful tumult broke out in the Constable's army.
The Spanish troops revolted, compelled him to flee, and pillaged
his tent. Then approaching the lansquenets, they began
to shout as loudly as they could, the only German words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
they knew: <i>Lance!</i> <i>lance!</i> <i>money!</i> <i>money!</i><a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> These words
found an echo in the bosoms of the Imperialists; they were
moved in their turn, and also began to cry with all their
might: <i>Lance!</i> <i>lance!</i> <i>money!</i> <i>money!</i> Freundsberg beat to
muster, and having drawn up the soldiers around him and
his principal officers, calmly demanded if he had ever deserted
them. All was useless. The old affection which the lansquenets
bore to their leader seemed extinct. One chord alone
vibrated in their hearts: they must have pay and war. Accordingly,
lowering their lances, they presented them, as if
they would slay their officers, and again began to shout,
"Lance! lance! money! money!"&mdash;Freundsberg, whom no
army however large had ever frightened! Freundsberg, who
was accustomed to say, "the more enemies, the greater the
honour," seeing these lansquenets, at whose head he had
grown gray, aiming their murderous steel against him, lost
all power of utterance, and fell senseless upon a drum, as if
struck with a thunderbolt.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The strength of the veteran general
was broken for ever. But the sight of their dying captain
produced on the lansquenets an effect that no speech could
have made. All the lances were upraised, and the agitated
soldiers retired with downcast eyes. Four days later, Freundsberg
recovered his speech. "Forward," said he to the Constable;
"God himself will bring us to the mark." Forward!
forward! repeated the lansquenets. Bourbon had no other alternative:
besides, neither Charles nor Clement would listen
to any propositions of peace. Freundsberg was carried to
Ferrara, and afterwards to his castle of Mindelheim, where he
died after an illness of eighteen months; and on the 18th
April, Bourbon took the highroad to Rome, which so many
formidable armies coming from the north had already trodden.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ASSAULT.</div>

<p>Whilst the storm descending from the Alps was approaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the eternal city, the Pope lost his presence of mind, sent
away his troops, and kept only his body-guard. More than
thirty thousand Romans, it is true, capable of bearing arms,
paraded their bravery in the streets, dragging their long-swords
after them, quarrelling and fighting; but these citizens, eager
in the pursuit of gain, had little thought of defending the
Pope, and desired on the contrary that the magnificent Charles
would come and settle in Rome, hoping to derive great profit
from his stay.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 5th May Bourbon arrived under the
walls of the capital; and he would have begun the assault
at that very moment if he had had ladders. On the morning
of the 6th the army, concealed by a thick fog which hid
their movements,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> was put in motion, the Spaniards marching
to their station above the gate of the Holy Ghost, and
the Germans below.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The Constable, wishing to encourage
his soldiers, seized a scaling-ladder, mounted the wall, and
called on them to follow him. At this moment a ball struck
him: he fell, and expired an hour after. Such was the end
of this unhappy man, a traitor to his king and to his country,
and suspected even by his new friends.</p>

<p>His death, far from checking, served only to excite the
army. Claudius Seidenstucker, grasping his long sword, first
cleared the wall; he was followed by Michael Hartmann,
and these two reformed Germans exclaimed that God himself
marched before them in the clouds. The gates were opened,
the army poured in, the suburbs were taken, and the Pope,
surrounded by thirteen cardinals, fled to the Castle of St. Angelo.
The Imperialists, at whose head was now the Prince
of Orange, offered him peace on condition of his paying
three hundred thousand crowns. But Clement, who thought
that the Holy League was on the point of delivering him,
and who fancied he already saw their leading horsemen, rejected
every proposition. After four hours' repose, the attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
was renewed, and by an hour after sunset the army was master
of all the city. It remained under arms and in good order
until midnight, the Spaniards in the Piazza Navona, and
the Germans in the Campofiore. At last, seeing no demonstrations
either of war or of peace, the soldiers disbanded and
ran to pillage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SACK.</div>

<p>Then began the famous "Sack of Rome." The Papacy
had for centuries put Christendom in the press. Prebends,
annates, jubilees, pilgrimages, ecclesiastical graces,&mdash;she had
made money of them all. These greedy troops, that for
months had lived in wretchedness, determined to make her
disgorge. No one was spared, the imperial not more than
the ultramontane party, the Ghibellines not more than the
Guelfs. Churches, palaces, convents, private houses, basilics,
banks, tombs&mdash;every thing was pillaged, even to the golden
ring that the corpse of Julius II. still wore on its finger.
The Spaniards displayed the greatest skill; they scented out
and discovered treasures in the most mysterious hiding-places;
but the Neapolitans were still more outrageous.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> "On every
side were heard," says Guicciardini, "the piteous shrieks of
the Roman women and of the nuns whom the soldiers dragged
away by companies to satiate their lust."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">GERMAN HUMOURS.</div>

<p>At first the Germans found a certain pleasure in making
the Papists feel the weight of their swords. But ere long,
happy at finding food and drink, they were more pacific
than their allies. It was upon those things which the Romans
called "holy" that the anger of the Lutherans was especially
discharged. They took away the chalices, the pyxes,
the silver remonstrances, and clothed their servants and camp-boys
with the sacerdotal garments.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The Campofiore was
changed into an immense gambling-house. The soldiers
brought thither golden vessels and bags full of crowns, staked
them upon one throw of the dice, and after losing them, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
went in search of others. A certain Simon Baptista, who had
foretold the sack of the city, had been thrown into prison by
the Pope; the Germans liberated him, and made him drink
with them. But, like Jeremiah, he prophesied against all.
"Rob, plunder," cried he to his liberators; "you shall however
give back all; the money of the soldiers and the gold of
the priests will follow the same road."</p>

<p>Nothing pleased the Germans more than to mock the papal
court. "Many prelates," says Guicciardini, "were paraded
on asses through all the city of Rome."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> After this procession,
the bishops paid their ransom; but they fell into the
hands of the Spaniards, who made them pay it a second
time.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>One day a lansquenet named Guillaume de Sainte Celle,
put on the Pope's robes, and placed the triple crown upon his
head; others, adorning themselves with the red hats and long
robes of the cardinals, surrounded him; and all going in procession
upon asses through the streets of the city, arrived at
last before the castle of Saint Angelo, where Clement VII.
had retired. Here the soldier-cardinals alighted, and lifting
up the front of their robes, kissed the feet of the pretended
pontiff. The latter drank to the health of Clement VII.,
the cardinals kneeling did the same, and exclaimed that
henceforward they would be pious popes and good cardinals,
who would have a care not to excite wars, as all their predecessors
had done. They then formed a conclave, and the
Pope having announced to his consistory that it was his intention
to resign the Papacy, all hands were immediately raised
for the election, and they cried out "Luther is Pope! Luther
is Pope!"<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Never had pontiff been proclaimed with such
perfect unanimity. Such were the humours of the Germans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VIOLENCE OF THE SPANIARDS.</div>

<p>The Spaniards did not let them off so easily. Clement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
VII. had called them "Moors," and had published a plenary,
indulgence for whoever should kill any of them. Nothing,
therefore, could restrain their fury. These faithful Catholics
put the prelates to death in the midst of horrible tortures, destined
to extort their treasures from them: they spared neither
rank, sex, nor age. It was not until after the sack had lasted
ten days, and a booty of ten million golden crowns had been
collected, and from five to eight thousand victims had perished,
that quiet began to be in some degree restored.</p>

<p>Thus did the pontifical city expire in the midst of a long
and cruel pillage, and that splendour with which Rome from
the beginning of the sixteenth century had filled the world
faded in a few hours. Nothing could preserve this haughty
city from chastisement, not even the prayers of its enemies.
"I would not have Rome burnt," Luther had exclaimed;
"it would be a monstrous deed."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The fears of Melancthon
were still keener: "I tremble for the libraries," said he, "we
know how hateful books are to Mars."<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> But in despite of
these wishes of the reformers, the city of Leo X. fell under
the judgment of God.</p>

<p>Clement VII., besieged in the castle of Saint Angelo, and
fearful that the enemy would blow his asylum into the air
with their mines, at last capitulated. He renounced every
alliance against Charles the Fifth, and bound himself to remain
a prisoner until he had paid the army four hundred
thousand ducats. The evangelical Christians gazed with astonishment
on this judgment of the Lord. "Such," said
they, "is the empire of Jesus Christ, that the Emperor, pursuing
Luther on account of the Pope, is constrained to ruin the
Pope instead of Luther. All things minister unto the Lord,
and turn against his adversaries."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">PROFITABLE CALM.</div>

<p>III. And in truth the Reform needed some years of repose
that it might increase and gain strength; and it could not
enjoy peace, unless its great enemies were at war with each
other. The madness of Clement VII. was as it were the
<i>lightning-conductor</i> of the Reformation, and the ruin of Rome
built up the Gospel. It was not only a few months' gain;
from 1526 to 1529 there was a calm in Germany by which
the Reformation profited to organize and extend itself. A
constitution was now to be given to the renovated Church.</p>

<p>The papal yoke having been broken, the ecclesiastical order
required to be reestablished. It was impossible to restore
their ancient jurisdiction to the bishops; for these continental
prelates maintained that they were, in an especial manner,
the Pope's servants. A new state of things was therefore
called for, under pain of seeing the Church fall into anarchy.
Provision was made for it. It was then that the evangelic
nations separated definitely from that despotic dominion
which had for ages kept all the West in bondage.</p>

<p>Already on two occasions the diet had wished to make the
reform of the Church a national work; the Emperor, the Pope,
and a few princes were opposed to it; the Diet of Spire had
therefore resigned to each state the task that it could not accomplish
itself.</p>

<p>But what constitution were they about to substitute for the
papal hierarchy?</p>

<p>They could, while suppressing the Pope, preserve the
Episcopal order: it was the form most approximate to that
which was on the point of being destroyed.</p>

<p>They might, on the contrary, reconstruct the ecclesiastical
order, by having recourse to the sovereignty of God's Word,
and by re-establishing the rights of the christian people.
This form was the most remote from the Roman hierarchy.
Between these two extremes there were several middle courses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PHILIP OF HESSE.</div>

<p>The latter plan was Zwingle's; but the reformer of Zurich
had not fully carried it out. He had not called upon
the christian people to exercise the sovereignty, and had stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
at the council of two hundred as representing the
Church.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The step before which Zwingle had hesitated might be
taken, and it was so. A prince did not shrink from what had
alarmed even republics. Evangelical Germany, at the moment
in which she began to try her hand on ecclesiastical
constitutions, began with that which trenched the deepest on
the papal monarchy.</p>

<p>It was not, however, from Germany that such a system
could proceed. If the aristocratic England was destined to
cling to the episcopal form, the docile Germany was destined
the rather to stop in a governmental medium. The democratic
extreme issued from Switzerland and France. One
of Calvin's predecessors then hoisted that flag which the powerful
arm of the Genevese Reformer was to lift again in after-years
and plant in France, Switzerland, Holland, Scotland,
and even in England, whence it was a century later to cross
the Atlantic and summon North America to take its rank
among the nations.</p>

<p>None of the evangelical princes was so enterprising as
Philip of Hesse, who has been compared to Philip of Macedon
in subtlety, and to his son Alexander in courage.
Philip comprehended that religion was at length acquiring
its due importance; and far from opposing the great development
that was agitating the people, he put himself in harmony
with the new ideas.</p>

<p>The morning-star had risen for Hesse almost at the same
time as for Saxony. In 1517, when Luther was preaching in
Wittemberg the gratuitous remission of sins, men and women
were seen in Marburg repairing secretly to one of the ditches
of the city, and there, near a solitary loophole, listening to the
words that issued from within, and that preached doctrines
of consolation through the bars. It was the voice of the
Franciscan, James Limburg, who having declared that, for
fifteen centuries, the priests had falsified the Gospel of Christ,
had been thrown into this gloomy dungeon. These mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
assemblies lasted a fortnight. On a sudden the voice
ceased; these lonely meetings had been discovered, and the
Franciscan, torn from his cell, had been hurried away across
the Lahnberg towards some unknown spot. Not far from the
Ziegenberg, some weeping citizens of Marburg came up with
him, and hastily snatching aside the canvass that covered his
car, they asked him, "Whither are you going?" "Where
God wills," calmly replied the friar.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> There was no more
talk of him, and it is not known what became of him. These
disappearances are usual in the Papacy.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Philip prevailed in the Diet of Spire, when
he resolved on devoting himself to the Reformation of his
hereditary states.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lambert's Paradoxes.</div>

<p>His resolute character made him incline towards the Swiss
reform: it was not therefore one of the moderates that he required.
He had formed a connexion at Spire with James
Sturm, the deputy from Strasburg, who spoke to him of Francis
Lambert of Avignon, who was then at Strasburg. Of
a pleasing exterior and decided character, Lambert added to
the fire of the South the perseverance of the North. He was
the first in France to throw off the cowl, and he had never
since then ceased to call for a radical reform in the Church.
"Formerly," said he, "when I was a hypocrite, I lived in
abundance; now I consume frugally my daily bread with
my small family;<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> but I had rather be poor in Christ's kingdom,
than possess abundance of gold in the dissolute dwellings
of the Pope." The Landgrave saw that Lambert was
such a man as he required, and invited him to his court.</p>

<p>Lambert, desiring to prepare the reform of Hesse, drew
up one hundred and fifty-eight theses, which he entitled "paradoxes,"
and posted them, according to the custom of the
times, on the church doors.</p>

<p>Friends and enemies immediately crowded round them.
Some Roman catholics would have torn them down, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
reformed townspeople kept watch, and holding a synod in the
public square, discussed, developed, proved these propositions,
and ridiculed the anger of the Papists.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRIAR BONIFACE.</div>

<p>A young priest, Boniface Dornemann, full of self-conceit,
whom the bishop, on the day of his consecration, had extolled
above Paul for his learning, and above the Virgin for his
chastity, finding himself too short to reach Lambert's placard,
had borrowed a stool, and surrounded by a numerous audience,
had begun to read the propositions aloud.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>"All that is deformed, ought to be reformed. The Word
of God alone teaches us what ought to be so, and all reform
that is effected otherwise is vain."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>This was the first thesis. "Hem!" said the young priest,
"I shall not attack that." He continued.</p>

<p>"It belongs to the Church to judge on matters of faith.
Now the Church is the congregation of those who are united
by the same spirit, the same faith, the same God, the same
Mediator, the same Word, by which alone they are governed,
and in which alone they have life."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>"I cannot attack that proposition," said the priest.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> He
continued reading from his stool.</p>

<p>"The Word is the true key. The kingdom of heaven is
open to him who believes the Word, and shut against him
who believes it not. Whoever, therefore, truly possesses the
Word of God, has the power of the keys. All other keys,
all the decrees of the councils and popes, and all the rules of
the monks, are valueless."</p>

<p>Friar Boniface shook his head and continued.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISPUTATION AT HOMBURG.</div>

<p>"Since the priesthood of the Law has been abolished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Christ is the only immortal and eternal priest, and he does
not, like men, need a successor. Neither the Bishop of Rome
nor any other person in the world is his representative here
below. But all Christians, since the commencement of the
Church, have been and are participators in his priesthood."</p>

<p>This proposition smelt of heresy. Dornemann, however,
was not discouraged; and whether it was from weakness of
mind, or from the dawning of light, at each proposition that
did not too much shock his prejudices, he failed not to repeat:
"Certainly, I shall not attack that one!" The people listened
in astonishment, when one of them,&mdash;whether he was a
fanatical Romanist, a fanatical Reformer, or a mischievous
wag, I cannot tell&mdash;tired of these continual repetitions, exclaimed:
"Get down, you knave, who cannot find a word to
impugn." Then rudely pulling the stool from under him, he
threw the unfortunate clerk flat in the mud.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>On the 21st October, at seven in the morning, the gates of
the principal church of Homburg were thrown open, and the
prelates, abbots, priests, counts, knights, and deputies of the
towns, entered in succession, and in the midst of them was
Philip, in his quality of first member of the Church.</p>

<p>After Lambert had explained and proved his theses, he added:
"Let him stand forth who has anything to say against
them." There was at first a profound silence; but at length
Nicholas Ferber, superior of the Franciscans of Marburg, who
in 1524, applying to Rome's favourite argument, had entreated
the Landgrave to employ the sword against the heretics, began
to speak with drooping head, and downcast eyes; but as
he invoked Augustin, Peter Lombard, and other doctors to his
assistance, the Landgrave observed to him: "Do not put forward
the wavering opinions of men, but the Word of God,
which alone fortifies and strengthens our hearts." The Franciscan
sat down in confusion, saying: "This is not the place
for replying." The disputation, however, recommenced, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Lambert, showing all the fire of the South, so astonished his
adversary, that the superior, alarmed at what he called "thunders
of blasphemy and lightnings of impiety,"<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> sat down
again, observing a second time, "This is not the place for replying."</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRIUMPH OF THE GOSPEL IN HESSE.</div>

<p>In vain did the Chancellor Feige declare to him that each
man had the right of maintaining his opinion with full liberty;
in vain did the Landgrave himself exclaim that the
Church was sighing after truth: silence had become Rome's
refuge. "I will defend the doctrine of purgatory," a priest
had said prior to the discussion; "I will attack the paradoxes
under the sixth head (on the true priesthood)," had said another;<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
and a third had exclaimed, "I will overthrow those
under the tenth head (on images);" but now they were all
dumb.</p>

<p>Upon this Lambert, clasping his hands, exclaimed with Zacharias:
<i>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited
and redeemed his people</i>.</p>

<p>After three days of discussion, which had been a continual
triumph for the evangelical doctrine, men were selected and
commissioned to constitute the churches of Hesse in accordance
with the Word of God. They were more than three
days occupied in the task, and then their new constitution was
published in the name of the synod.</p>

<p>The first ecclesiastical constitution produced by the Reformation
should have a place in history, so much the more as it
was then set forward as a model for the new Churches of
Christendom.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH.</div>

<p>The autonomy or self-government of the Church is its fundamental
principle: it is from the Church, from its representatives
assembled in the name of the Lord, that this legislation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
emanates; there is no mention in the prologue either of state
or of Landgrave.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Philip, content with having broken for
himself and for his people the yoke of a foreign priest, had
no desire to put himself in his place, and was satisfied with
an external superintendence, necessary for the maintenance
of order.</p>

<p>A second distinctive feature in this constitution is its simplicity
both of government and worship. The assembly
conjures all future synods not to load the Churches with a
multitude of ordinances, "seeing that where orders abound,
disorder superabounds." They would not even continue
the organs in the churches, because, said they, "men should
understand what they hear."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The more the human mind
has been bent in one direction, the more violent is the reaction
in the contrary direction when it is unbent. The Church
passed at that time from the extreme of symbols to that of
simplicity. These are the principal features of this constitution:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Church can only be taught and governed by the
Word of its Sovereign Pastor. Whoever has recourse to any
other word shall be deposed and excommunicated.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>"Every pious man, learned in the Word of God, whatever
be his condition, may be elected bishop if he desire it, for
he is called inwardly of God.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>"Let no one believe that by a bishop we understand anything
else than a simple minister of the Word of God.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>"The ministers are servants, and consequently they ought
not to be lords, princes, or governors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH&mdash;BISHOPS.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>"Let the faithful assemble and choose their bishops and
deacons. Each church should elect its own pastor.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>"Let those who are elected bishops be consecrated to their
office by the imposition of the hands of three bishops; and as
for the deacons, if there are no ministers present, let them receive
the laying on of hands from the elders of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>"If a bishop causes any scandal to the Church by his effeminacy,
or by the splendour of his garments, or by the levity
of his conduct, and if, on being warned, he persists, let him be
deposed by the Church.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>"Let each church place its bishop in a condition to live
with his family, and to be hospitable, as St. Paul enjoins; but
let the bishops exact nothing for their casual duties.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>"On every Sunday let there be in some suitable place an assembly
of all the men who are in the number of the saints, to
regulate with the bishop, according to God's Word, all the
affairs of the Church, and to excommunicate whoever gives
occasion of scandal to the Church; for the Church of Christ
has never existed without exercising the power of excommunication.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>"As a weekly assembly is necessary for the direction of
the particular churches, so a general synod should be held annually
for the direction of all the churches in the country.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">TWO ELEMENTS IN THE CHURCH.</div>

<p>"All the pastors are its natural members; but each church
shall further elect from its body a man full of the Spirit and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of faith, to whom it shall intrust powers for all that is in the
jurisdiction of the synod.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>"Three visiters shall be elected yearly, with commission to
go through all the churches, to examine those who have been
elected bishops, to confirm those who have been approved of,
and to provide for the execution of the decrees of the synod."</p>

<p>It will no doubt be found that this first evangelical constitution
went in some points to the extreme of ecclesiastical democracy;
but certain institutions had crept in that were
capable of increase and of changing its nature. Six superintendents
for life were afterwards substituted for these annual
visiters (who, according to the primitive institution, might be
simple members of the church); and, as has been remarked,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
the encroachments, whether of these superintendents or of
the state, gradually paralyzed the activity and independence
of the churches of Hesse. This constitution fared as did
that of the Abbé Sièyes, in the year 8, which, being destined
to be republican, served through the influence of Napoleon
Bonaparte to establish the despotism of the Empire.</p>

<p>It was not the less a remarkable work. Romish doctors
have reproached the Reformation for making the Church a
too interior institution.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> In effect, the Reformation and Popery
recognise two elements in the Church,&mdash;the one exterior,
the other interior; but while Popery gives precedence to the
former, the Reformation assigns it to the latter. If however
it be a reproach against the Reformation for having an inward
Church only, and for not creating an external one, the
remarkable constitution of which we have just exhibited a few
features, will save us the trouble of reply. The exterior ecclesiastical
order, which then sprung from the very heart of
the Reformation, is far more perfect than that of Popery.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">LUTHER ON THE MINISTRY.</div>

<p>One great question presented itself: Will these principles
be adopted by all the Churches of the Reformation?</p>

<p>Everything seemed to indicate as much. The most pious
men thought at that time that the ecclesiastical power proceeded
from the members of the Church. By withdrawing
from the hierarchical extreme, they flung themselves into a
democratical one. Luther himself had professed this doctrine
as early as 1523. The Calixtins of Bohemia, on seeing the
bishops of their country refuse them ministers, had gone so far
as to take the first vagabond priest. "If you have no other
means of procuring pastors," wrote Luther to them, "rather
do without them, and let each head of a family read the
Gospel in his own house, and baptise his children, sighing after
the sacrament of the altar as the Jews at Babylon did for
Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> The consecration of the Pope creates priests&mdash;not
of God, but of the devil, ordained solely to trample Jesus
Christ under foot, to bring his sacrifice to naught, and to sell
imaginary holocausts to the world in his name.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Men become
ministers only by election and calling, and that ought
to be effected in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>"First, seek God by prayer;<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> then being assembled together
with all those whose hearts God has touched, choose in the
Lord's name him or them whom you shall have acknowledged
to be fitted for this ministry. After that, let the chief
men among you lay their hands on them, and recommend
them to the people and to the Church."<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH.</div>

<p>Luther, in thus calling upon the people alone to nominate
their pastors, submitted to the necessities of the times. It was
requisite to constitute the ministry; but the ministry having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
no existence, it could not then have the legitimate part that
belongs to it in the choice of God's ministers.</p>

<p>But another necessity, proceeding in like manner from the
state of affairs, was to incline Luther to deviate from the principles
he had laid down.</p>

<p>The German Reformation can hardly be said to have begun
with the lower classes, as in Switzerland and France;
and Luther could scarcely find anywhere that christian people,
which should have played so great a part in his new constitution.
Ignorant men, conceited townspeople, who would
not even maintain their ministers&mdash;these were the members
of the Church. Now what could be done with such elements?</p>

<p>But if the people were indifferent, the princes were not so.
They stood in the foremost rank of the battle, and sat on the
first bench in the council. The democratic organization was
therefore compelled to give way to an organization conformable
to the civil government. The Church is composed of
Christians, and they are taken wherever they are found&mdash;high
or low. It was particularly in high stations that Luther
found them. He admitted the princes as representatives of the
people; and henceforward the influence of the state became
one of the principal elements in the constitution of the evangelical
Church.</p>

<p>In the mind of the Reformer, this guardianship of the
princes was only to be provisional. The faithful being then
in minority, they had need of a guardian; but the era of the
Church's majority might arrive, and with it would come its
emancipation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S LETTER TO THE ELECTOR.</div>

<p>We may admit that this recourse to the civil power was at
that time necessary, but we cannot deny that it was also a
source of difficulties. We will point out only one. When
Protestantism became an affair of governments and nations, it
ceased to be universal. The new spirit was capable of creating
a new earth. But instead of opening new roads, and of
purposing the regeneration of all Christendom, and the conversion
of the whole world, the Protestants sought to settle
themselves as comfortably as possible in a few German duchies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
This timidity, which has been called prudence, did immense
injury to the Reformation.</p>

<p>The organizing power being once discovered, the Reformers
thought of organization, and Luther applied to the task;
for although he was in an especial manner an assailant and
Calvin an organizer, these two qualities, as necessary to the
reformers of the Church as to the founders of empires, were
not wanting in either of these great servants of God.</p>

<p>It was necessary to compose a new ministry, for most of
the priests who had quitted the Papacy were content to receive
the watchword of Reform without having personally
experienced the sanctifying virtue of the Truth. There was
even one parish in which the priest preached the Gospel
in his principal church, and sang mass in its succursal.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
But something more was wanting: a Christian people had to
be created. "Alas!" said Luther of some of the adherents of
the Reform, "they have abandoned their Romish doctrines
and rites, and they scoff at ours."<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">GERMAN MASS.</div>

<p>Luther did not shrink from before this double necessity;
and he made provision for it. Understanding that a general
visitation of the churches was necessary, he addressed the Elector
on this subject, on the 22d October 1526. "Your highness,
in your quality of guardian of youth, and of all those
who know not how to take care of themselves," said he,
"should compel the inhabitants, who desire neither pastors
nor schools, to receive these means of grace, as they are compelled
to work on the roads, on bridges, and such like services.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
The papal order being abolished, it is your duty to
regulate these things; no other person cares about them, no
other can, and no other ought to do so. Commission, therefore,
four persons to visit all the country; let two of them inquire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
into the tithes and church property; and let two take
charge of the doctrine, schools, churches, and pastors." We
naturally ask, on reading these words, if the church which was
formed in the first century, without the support of princes,
could not in the sixteenth be reformed without them?</p>

<p>Luther was not content with soliciting in writing the intervention
of the prince. He was indignant at seeing the courtiers,
who in the time of the Elector Frederick had shown
themselves the inveterate enemies of the Reformation, rushing
now, "sporting, laughing, skipping," as he said, on the
spoils of the Church. Accordingly, at the end of this year,
the Elector having come to Wittemberg, the Reformer repaired
immediately to the palace, made his complaint to the
prince-electoral, whom he met at the gate, then without caring
about those who stopped him, made his way by force into
his father's bedchamber, and addressing this prince, who was
surprised at so unexpected a visit, begged him to remedy the
evils of the Church. The visitation of the churches was resolved
upon, and Melancthon was commissioned to draw up
the necessary instructions.</p>

<p>In 1526, Luther had published his "German Mass," by
which he signified the order of church service in general.
"The real evangelical assemblies," he said, "do not take
place publicly, pellmell, admitting people of every sort;<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
but they are formed of serious Christians, who confess the
Gospel by their words and by their lives,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and in the midst
of whom we may reprove and excommunicate, according to
the rule of Christ Jesus.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> I cannot institute such assemblies,
for I have no one to place in them;<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> but if the thing becomes
possible, I shall not be wanting in this duty."</p>

<div class="sidenote">MELANCTHON'S INSTRUCTIONS.</div>

<p>It was also with a conviction that he must give the Church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
not the best form of worship imaginable, but the best possible,
that Melancthon laboured at his Instructions.</p>

<p>The German Reformation at that time tacked about, as it
were. If Lambert in Hesse had gone to the extreme of a
democratical system, Melancthon in Saxony was approximating
the contrary extreme of traditional principles. A conservative
principle was substituted for a reforming one. Melancthon
wrote to one of the inspectors:<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> "All the old ceremonies
that you can preserve, pray do so.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Do not innovate
much, for every innovation is injurious to the people."<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>They retained, therefore, the Latin liturgy, a few German
hymns being mingled with it;<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> the communion in one kind
for those only who scrupled from habit to take it in both;
a confession made to the priest without being in any way
obligatory; many saints' days, the sacred vestments,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and
other rites, "in which," said Melancthon, "there is no harm,
whatever Zwingle may say."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> And at the same time they
set forth with reserve the doctrines of the Reformation.</p>

<p>It is but right to confess the dominion of facts and circumstances
upon these ecclesiastical organizations; but there is a
dominion which rises higher still&mdash;that of the Word of God.</p>

<p>Perhaps what Melancthon did was all that could be effected
at that time: but it was necessary for the work to be one day
resumed and re-established on its primitive plan, and this was
Calvin's glory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISAFFECTION.</div>

<p>A cry of astonishment was heard both from the camp of
Rome and from that of the Reformation. "Our cause is betrayed,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
exclaimed some of the evangelical Christians: "the
liberty is taken away that Jesus Christ had given us."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>On their part the Ultramontanists triumphed in Melancthon's
moderation: they called it a retractation, and took advantage
of it to insult the Reform. Cochl&oelig;us published a
"horrible" engraving, as he styles it himself, in which, from
beneath the same hood was seen issuing a seven-headed monster
representing Luther. Each of these heads had different
features, and all, uttering together the most frightful and
contradictory words, kept disputing, tearing, and devouring
each other.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The astonished Elector resolved to communicate Melancthon's
paper to Luther. But never did the Reformer's respect
for his friend show itself in a more striking manner. He
only made one or two unimportant additions to this plan, and
sent it back accompanied with the highest eulogiums. The
Romanists said that the tiger caught in a net was licking the
hands that clipped his talons. But it was not so. Luther
knew that the aim of Melancthon's labours was to strengthen
the very soul of the Reformation in all the churches of Saxony.
That was sufficient for him. He thought besides, that in
every thing there must be a transition; and being justly convinced
that his friend was more than himself a man of transition,
he frankly accepted his views.</p>

<p>The general visitation began. Luther in Saxony, Spalatin
in the districts of Altenburg and Zwickau, Melancthon in
Thuringia, and Thuring in Franconia, with ecclesiastical deputies
and several lay colleagues, commenced the work in
October and November 1528.</p>

<p>They purified the clergy by dismissing every priest of scandalous

to the maintenance of public worship, and they placed the remainder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
beyond the reach of plunder; they continued the
suppression of the convents; they established everywhere
unity of instruction; and "Luther's greater and smaller catechisms,"
which appeared in 1529, contributed more perhaps
than any other writings to propagate throughout the new
churches the ancient faith of the Apostles; they commissioned
the pastors of the great towns, under the title of superintendents,
to watch over the churches and the schools; they
maintained the abolition of celibacy; and the ministers of
the Word, become husbands and fathers, formed the germ of
a third estate, whence in after-years were diffused in all ranks
of society learning, activity, and light. This is one of the
truest causes of the intellectual and moral superiority that indisputably
distinguishes the evangelical nations.</p>

<p>The organization of the churches in Saxony, notwithstanding
its imperfections, produced for that time at least the most
important results. This was because the Word of God prevailed;
and because, wherever this Word exercises its power,
secondary errors and abuses are paralyzed. The very discretion
that was employed proceeded in reality from a good principle.
The reformers, unlike the enthusiasts, did not utterly
reject an institution because it was corrupted. They did not
say, for example: "The sacraments are disfigured, let us do
without them! the ministry is corrupt, let us reject it!"&mdash;but
they rejected the abuse, and restored the use. This prudence
is the mark of a work of God; and if Luther sometimes permitted
the chaff to remain along with the wheat, Calvin appeared
later, and more thoroughly purged the Christian
threshing-floor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE REFORMATION ADVANCES.</div>

<p>The organization which was at that time accomplishing
in Saxony, exerted a strong reaction on all the German empire,
and the doctrine of the Gospel advanced with gigantic
strides. The design of God in turning aside from the reformed
states of Germany, the thunderbolt that he caused to fall
upon the seven-hilled city, was clearly manifest. Never were
years more usefully employed; and it was not only to framing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
a constitution that the Reformation devoted itself, it was
also to extend its doctrine.</p>

<p>The duchies of Luneburg and Brunswick, many of the
most important imperial cities, as Nuremberg, Augsburg,
Ulm, Strasburg, Gottingen, Gosslar, Nordhausen, Lubeck,
Bremen, and Hamburg, removed the tapers from the chapels,
and substituted in their place the brighter torch of the Word
of God.</p>

<p>In vain did the frightened canons allege the authority of
the Church. "The authority of the Church," replied Kempe
and Zechenhagen, the reformer of Hamburg, "cannot be acknowledged
unless the Church herself obeys her pastor Jesus
Christ."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Pomeranus visited many places to put a finishing
hand to the Reform.</p>

<p>In Franconia, the Margrave George of Brandenburg, having
reformed Anspach and Bayreuth, wrote to his ancient
protector, Ferdinand of Austria, who had knit his brows on
hearing of his reforming proceedings: "I have done this by
God's order; for he commands princes to take care not only
of the bodies of their subjects, but also of their souls."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>In East Friesland, on new-year's day, 1527, a Dominican
named Resius, having put on his hood,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> ascended the pulpit
at Noorden, and declared himself ready to maintain certain
theses according to the tenor of the Gospel. Having silenced
the Abbot of Noorden by the soundness of his arguments,
Resius took off his cowl, laid it on the pulpit, and was received
in the nave by the acclamations of the faithful. Ere
long the whole of Friesland laid aside the uniform of Popery,
as Resius had done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A PIOUS PRINCESS.</div>

<p>At Berlin, Elizabeth, electress of Brandenburg, having read
Luther's works, felt a desire to receive the Lord's supper in
conformity with Christ's institution: a minister secretly administered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
it at the festival of Easter, 1528; but one of her children
informed the Elector. Joachim was greatly exasperated,
and ordered his wife to keep her room for several days;<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> it
was even said that he intended to shut her up.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> This princess,
being deprived of all religious support, and mistrusting
the perfidious man&oelig;uvres of the Romish priests, resolved to
escape by flight; and she claimed the assistance of her brother,
Christian II. of Denmark, who was then residing at Torgau.
Taking advantage of a dark night, she quitted the castle in a
peasant's dress, and got into a rude country-waggon that was
waiting for her at the gate of the city. Elizabeth urged on
the driver, when, in a bad road, the wain broke down. The
electress, hastily unfastening a handkerchief she wore round
her head, flung it to the man, who employed it in repairing
the damage, and ere long Elizabeth arrived at Torgau. "If
I should expose you to any risk," said she to her uncle, the
Elector of Saxony, "I am ready to go wherever Providence
may guide me." But John assigned her a residence in the
castle of Lichtenberg, on the Elbe, near Wittemberg. Without
taking upon us to approve of Elizabeth's flight, let us acknowledge
the good that God's Providence drew from it.
This amiable lady, who lived at Lichtenberg, in the study of
His word, seldom appearing at court, frequently going to hear
Luther's sermons, and exercising a salutary influence over her
children, who sometimes had permission to see her, was the
first of those pious princesses whom the house of Brandenburg
has counted, and even still counts, among its members.</p>

<p>At the same time, Holstein, Sleswick, and Silesia decided
in favour of the Reformation: and Hungary, as well as Bohemia,
saw the number of its adherents increase.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EDICT OF OFEN.</div>

<p>In every place, instead of a hierarchy seeking its righteousness
in the works of man, its glory in external pomp, its
strength in a material power, the Church of the Apostles reappeared,
humble as in primitive times, and like the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Christians, looking for its righteousness, its glory, and its power
solely in the blood of Christ and in the Word of God.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>IV. All these triumphs of the Gospel could not pass unperceived;
there was a powerful reaction, and until political circumstances
should permit a grand attack upon the Reformation
on the very soil where it was established, and of persecuting
it by means of diets, and if necessary by armies, they
began to persecute in detail in the Romish countries with
tortures and the scaffold.</p>

<p>On the 20th August, 1527, King Ferdinand, by the Edict
of Ofen in Hungary, published a tariff of crimes and penalties,
in which he threatened death by the sword, by fire, or by
water,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> against whoever should say that Mary was a woman
like other women; or partake of the sacrament in an heretical
manner; or consecrate the bread and wine, not being a Romish
priest; and further, in the second case, the house in which
the sacrament should have been administered was to be confiscated
or rased to the ground.</p>

<p>Such was not the legislation of Luther. Link having
asked him if it were lawful for the magistrate to put the false
prophets to death, meaning the Sacramentarians, whose doctrines
Luther attacked with so much force,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> the Reformer
replied: "I am slow whenever life is concerned, even if the
offender is exceedingly guilty.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> I can by no means admit
that the false teachers should be put to death;<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> it is sufficient
to remove them." For ages the Romish Church has
bathed in blood. Luther was the first to profess the great
principles of humanity and religious liberty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">PERSECUTIONS&mdash;WINKLER AND CARPENTER.</div>

<p>They sometimes had recourse to more expeditious proceedings
than the scaffold itself. George Winkler, pastor of Halle,
having been summoned before Archbishop Albert in the
spring of 1527, for having administered the sacrament in both
kinds, had been acquitted. As this minister was returning
home along an unfrequented road in the midst of the woods,
he was suddenly attacked by a number of horsemen, who
murdered him, and immediately fled through the thickets
without taking anything from his person.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> "The world,"
exclaimed Luther, "is a cavern of assassins under the command
of the devil; an inn, whose landlord is a brigand, and
which bears this sign, <i>Lies and Murder</i>; and none are more
readily murdered therein than those who proclaim Jesus
Christ."</p>

<p>At Munich George Carpenter was led to the scaffold for having
denied that the baptism of water is able by its own virtue
to save a man. "When you are thrown into the fire,"
said some of his brethren, "give us a sign by which we
may know that you persevere in the faith."&mdash;"As long as
I can open my mouth, I will confess the name of the Lord
Jesus."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The executioner stretched him on a ladder, tied a
small bag of gunpowder round his neck, and then flung him
into the flames. Carpenter immediately cried out, "Jesus!
Jesus!" and the executioner having turned him again and
again with his hooks, the martyr several times repeated the
word Jesus, and expired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PERSECUTIONS&mdash;KEYSER.</div>

<p>At Landsberg nine persons were consigned to the flames,
and at Munich twenty-nine were thrown into the water. At
Scherding, Leonard Keyser, a friend and disciple of Luther,
having been condemned by the bishop, had his head shaved,
and being dressed in a smock-frock, was placed on horseback.
As the executioners were cursing and swearing, because they
could not disentangle the ropes with which he was to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
bound, he said to them mildly: "Dear friends, your bonds
are not necessary; my Lord Christ has already bound me."
When he drew near the stake, Keyser looked at the crowd
and exclaimed: "Behold the harvest! O Master, send forth
thy labourers!" He then ascended the scaffold and said: "O
Jesu, save me! I am thine." These were his last words.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
"Who am I, a wordy preacher," exclaimed Luther, when he
received the news of his death, "in comparison with this great
doer?"<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Thus, the Reformation manifested by such striking works
the truth that it had come to re-establish; namely, that faith
is not, as Rome maintains, an historical, vain, dead knowledge,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
but a lively faith, the work of the Holy Ghost, the channel
by which Christ fills the heart with new desires and with new
affections, the true worship of the living God.</p>

<p>These martyrdoms filled Germany with horror, and gloomy
forebodings descended from the thrones among the ranks of
the people. Around the domestic hearth, in the long winter
evenings, the conversation wholly turned on prisons, tortures,
scaffolds, and martyrs; and the slightest noise alarmed the
old men, women, and children. These narratives gained
strength from mouth to mouth; the rumour of a universal
conspiracy against the Gospel spread through all the Empire.
Its adversaries, taking advantage of this terror, announced
with a mysterious air that they must look during this year
(1528) for some decisive measure against the Reform.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> One
scoundrel resolved to profit by this state of mind to satisfy his
avarice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PACK'S FORGERY.</div>

<p>No blows are more terrible to a cause than those which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
inflicts upon itself. The Reformation, seized with a dizziness,
was on the verge of self-destruction. There is a spirit of
error that conspires against the cause of truth, beguiling by
subtlety;<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> the Reformation was about to experience its attacks,
and to stagger under the most formidable assault,&mdash;perturbation
of thought, and estrangement from the ways of wisdom
and of truth.</p>

<p>Otho of Pack, vice-chancellor to Duke George of Saxony,
was a crafty and dissipated man,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> who took advantage of his
office, and had recourse to all sorts of practices to procure
money. The Duke having on one occasion sent him to the
Diet of Nuremberg as his representative, the Bishop of Merseburg
confided to him his contribution towards the imperial
government. The Bishop having been afterwards called upon
for this money, Pack declared that he had paid it to a citizen
of Nuremberg, whose seal and signature he produced.
This paper was a forgery; Pack himself was the author of
it.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> This wretch, however, put an impudent face on the
matter, and as he was not convicted, he preserved the confidence
of his master. Erelong an opportunity presented itself
of exercising his criminal talent on a larger scale.</p>

<p>No one entertained greater suspicions with regard to the
Papists than the Landgrave of Hesse. Young, susceptible,
and restless, he was always on the alert. In the month of
February 1528, Pack happening to be at Cassel to assist
Philip in some difficult business, the Landgrave imparted to
him his fears. If any one could have had any knowledge
of the designs of the Papists, it must have been the vice-chancellor,
one of the greatest enemies to the Reform. The
crafty Pack heaved a sigh, bent down his eyes, and was silent.
Philip immediately became uneasy, entreated him, and promised
to do nothing that would injure the Duke. Then, Pack
as if he had allowed an important secret to be torn from him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
with regret, confessed that a league against the Lutherans had
been concluded at Breslau on the Wednesday following <i>Jubilate</i>
Sunday, 12th May 1527; and engaged to procure the
original of this act for the Landgrave, who offered him for
this service a remuneration of ten thousand florins. This
was the greatest transaction that this wretched man had ever
undertaken; but it tended to nothing less than the utter overthrow
of the Empire.</p>

<p>The Landgrave was amazed: he restrained himself, however,
wishing to see the act with his own eyes before informing
his allies. He therefore repaired to Dresden. "I cannot,"
said Pack, "furnish you with the original: the Duke
always carries it about his person to read it to other princes
whom he hopes to gain over. Recently at Leipsic, he showed
it to Duke Henry of Brunswick. But here is a copy made
by his highness's order." The Landgrave took the document,
which bore all the marks of the most perfect authenticity.
It was crossed by a cord of black silk, and fastened at both
ends by the seal of the ducal chancery.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Above was an impression
from the ring Duke George always wore on his finger,
with the three quarterings that Philip had so often seen;
at the top, the coronet, and at the bottom, the two lions. He
has no more doubts as to its authenticity. But how can we
describe his indignation as he read this guilty document?
King Ferdinand, the Electors of Mentz and of Brandenburg,
Duke George of Saxony, the Dukes of Bavaria, the Bishops
of Salzburg, Wurtzburg, and Bamberg, have entered into a
coalition to call upon the Elector of Saxony to deliver up the
arch-heretic Luther, with all the apostate priests, monks, and
nuns, and to re-establish the ancient worship. If he make
default, his states are to be invaded, and this prince and his
descendants are to be for ever dispossessed. The same measure
was next to be applied to the Landgrave, only ("it was
your father-in-law, Duke George," said Pack to Philip, "who
got this clause inserted") his states shall be restored to him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
consideration of his youth, if he becomes fully reconciled to
the Holy Church. The document stated moreover the contingents
of men and money to be provided by the confederates,
and the share they were to have in the spoils of these two
heretical princes.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Many circumstances tended to confirm the authenticity of
this paper. Ferdinand, Joachim of Brandenburg, and George
of Saxony, had in fact met at Breslau on the day indicated,
and an evangelical prince, the Margrave George, had seen
Joachim leave Ferdinand's apartments, holding in his hand
a large parchment to which several seals were attached. The
agitated Landgrave caused a copy to be taken of this document,
promised secrecy for a time, paid Pack four thousand
florins, and engaged to make up the sum agreed upon, if he
would procure him the original. And then, wishing to prevent
the storm, he hastened to Weimar to inform the Elector
of this unprecedented conspiracy.</p>

<p>"I have seen," said he to John and his son, "nay more&mdash;I
have had in my hands, a duplicate of this horrible treaty.
Signatures, seals&mdash;nothing was wanting.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Here is a copy,
and I bind myself to place the original before your eyes.
The most frightful danger threatens us&mdash;ourselves, our faithful
subjects, and the Word of God."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADVICE OF THE REFORMERS.</div>

<p>The Elector had no reason to doubt the account the Landgrave
had just given him: he was stunned, confounded, and
overpowered. The promptest measures alone could avert
such unheard of disasters: everything must be risked to extricate
them from certain destruction. The impetuous Philip
breathed fire and flames;<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> his plan of defence was already
prepared. He presented it, and in the first moment of consternation
he carried the consent of his ally, as it were by assault.
On the 9th March 1528, the two princes agreed to
employ all their forces to defend themselves, and even to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the offensive, and to sacrifice life, honour, rank, subjects, and
states, to preserve the Word of God. The Dukes of Prussia,
Mecklenburg, Luneburg, and Pomerania, the Kings of Denmark
and Poland, and the Margrave of Brandenburg, were
to be invited to enter into this alliance. Six hundred thousand
florins were destined for the expenses of the war; and to procure
them, they would raise loans, pledge their cities, and sell
the offerings in the churches.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> They had already begun to
raise a powerful army.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> The Landgrave set out in person
for Nuremberg and Anspach. The alarm was general in
those countries; the commotion was felt throughout all Germany,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
and even beyond it. John Zapolya, King of Hungary,
at that time a refugee at Cracow, promised a hundred
thousand florins to raise an army, and twenty thousand florins
a month for its maintenance. Thus a spirit of error was
misleading the princes; if it should carry away the Reformers
also, the destruction of the Reformation was not far distant.</p>

<p>But God was watching over them. Supported on the rock
of the Word, Melancthon and Luther replied: "It is written,
Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God." As soon as these
two men whom the danger threatened (for it was they who
were to be delivered up to the papal power) saw the youthful
Landgrave drawing the sword, and the aged Elector himself
putting his hand on the hilt, they uttered a cry, and this cry,
which was heard in heaven, saved the Reform.</p>

<p>Luther, Pomeranus, and Melancthon immediately forwarded
the following advice to the Elector: "Above all things, let
not the attack proceed from our side, and let no blood be shed
through our fault. Let us wait for the enemy, and seek after
peace. Send an ambassador to the Emperor to make him
acquainted with this hateful plot."</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S PACIFIC COUNSEL.</div>

<p>Thus it was that the faith of the children of God, which is
so despised by politicians, conducted them aright, at the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
moment when the diplomatists were going astray. The Elector
and his son declared to the Landgrave that they would
not assume the offensive. Philip was in amazement. "Are
not the preparations of the Papists worthy an attack?" asked
he.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> "What! we will threaten war, and yet not make it!
We will inflame the hatred of our antagonists, and leave them
time to prepare their forces! No, no; forward! It is thus
we shall secure the means of an honourable peace."&mdash;&mdash;"If
the Landgrave desires to begin the war," replied the Reformer,
"the Elector is not obliged to observe the treaty; for we must
obey God rather than men. God and the right are above
every alliance. Let us beware of painting the devil on our
doors, and inviting him as godfather.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> But if the Landgrave
is attacked, the Elector ought to go to his assistance; for it is
God's will that we preserve our faith." This advice which
the Reformers gave, cost them dear. Never did man, condemned
to the torture, endure a punishment like theirs. The
fears excited by the Landgrave were succeeded by the terrors
inspired by the Papist princes. This cruel trial left them in
great distress. "I am worn away with sorrow," cried Melancthon;
"and this anguish puts me to the most horrible
torture.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> The issue," added he, "will be found on our knees
before God."<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>The Elector, drawn in different directions by the theologians
and the politicians, at last took a middle course: he
resolved to assemble an army, "but only," said he, "to obtain
peace." Philip of Hesse at length gave way, and forthwith
sent copies of the famous treaty to Duke George, to the
Dukes of Bavaria, and to the Emperor's representatives, calling
upon them to renounce such cruel designs. "I would
rather have a limb cut off," said he to his father-in-law, "than
know you to be a member of such an alliance."</p>

<div class="sidenote">SURPRISE OF THE PAPIST PRINCES.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>The surprise of the German courts, when they read this
document, is beyond description. Duke George immediately
replied to the Landgrave that he had allowed himself to be
deceived by unmeaning absurdities; that he who pretended
to have seen the original of this act was an infamous liar, and
an incorrigible scoundrel; and that he called upon the Landgrave
to give up his authority, or else it might well be thought
that he was himself the inventor of this impudent fabrication.
King Ferdinand, the Elector of Brandenburg, and all the
pretended conspirators made similar replies.</p>

<p>Philip of Hesse saw that he had been deceived;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> his confusion
was only exceeded by his anger. He had therefore
himself justified the accusations of his adversaries who called
him a hot-headed young man, and had compromised to the
highest degree the cause of the Reformation and that of his
people. He said afterwards, "If that had not happened, it
would no more happen now. Nothing that I have done in
all my life has caused me greater vexation."</p>

<p>Pack fled in alarm to the Landgrave, who caused him to
be arrested; and envoys from the several princes whom this
scoundrel had compromised met at Cassel, and proceeded to
examine him. He maintained that the original act of the alliance
had really existed in the Dresden archives. In the
following year the Landgrave banished him from Hesse,
showing by this action that he did not fear him. Pack was
afterwards discovered in Belgium; and at the demand of
Duke George, who had never shown any pity towards him,
he was seized, tortured, and finally beheaded.</p>

<p>The Landgrave was unwilling to have taken up arms to no
purpose. The archbishop-elector of Mentz was compelled, on
the 11th June, 1528, to renounce in the camp of Herzkirchen
all spiritual jurisdiction in Saxony and Hesse.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> This was no
small advantage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PACK'S SCHEME NOT IMPROBABLE.</div>

<p>Scarcely had the arms been laid aside, before Luther took
up his pen, and began a war of another kind. "Impious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
princes may deny this alliance as long as they please," wrote
he to Link; "I am very certain that it is not a chimera.
These insatiable leeches will take no repose until they see
the whole of Germany flowing with blood."<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> This idea of
Luther's was the one generally entertained. "The document
presented to the Landgrave may be," it was said,
"Pack's invention; but all this fabric of lies is founded on
some truth. If the alliance has not been concluded, it has
been conceived."<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>Melancholy were the results of this affair. It inspired division
in the bosom of the Reformation, and fanned the hatred
between the two parties.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> The sparks from the piles of
Keyser, Winckler, Carpenter, and so many other martyrs,
added strength to the fire that was already threatening to set
the empire in flames. It was under such critical circumstances,
and with such menacing dispositions, that the famous
Diet of Spire was opened in March 1529. The Empire and
the Papacy were in reality preparing to annihilate the Reformation,
although in a manner different from what Pack
had pretended. It was still to be learnt whether there would
be found in the revived Church more vital strength than
there had been in so many sects that Rome had easily
crushed. Happily the faith had increased, and the constitution
given to the Church had imparted greater power to its
adherents. All were resolved on defending a doctrine so
pure, and a church government so superior to that of Popery.
During three years of tranquillity, the Gospel tree had struck
its roots deep; and if the storm should burst, it would now
be able to brave it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ALLIANCE BETWEEN CHARLES AND CLEMENT.</div>

<p>V. The sack of Rome, by exasperating the adherents of
the Papacy, had given arms to all the enemies of Charles V.
The French army under Lautrec had forced the imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
army, enervated by the delights of a new Capua, to hide itself
within the walls of Naples. Doria, at the head of his
Genoese galleys, had destroyed the Spanish fleet, and all the
imperial power seemed drawing to an end in Italy. But
Doria suddenly declared for the Emperor; pestilence carried
off Lautrec and half of his troops; and Charles, suffering
only from alarm, had again grasped the power with a firm
resolution to unite henceforward closely with the Pontiff,
whose humiliation had nearly cost him so dear. On his side
Clement VII., hearing the Italians reproach him for his illegitimate
birth, and even refuse him the title of Pope, said
aloud, that he would rather be the Emperor's groom than the
sport of his people. On the 29th June, 1528, a peace between
the heads of the Empire and of the Church was concluded
at Barcelona, based on the destruction of heresy; and
in November a diet was convoked to meet at Spire on
the 21st February, 1529. Charles was resolved to endeavour
at first to destroy the Reform by a federal vote; but if this vote
did not suffice, to employ his whole power against it. The
road being thus traced out, they were about to commence
operations.</p>

<p>Germany felt the seriousness of the position. Mournful
omens filled every mind. About the middle of January, a
great light had suddenly dispersed the darkness of the night.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
"What that forebodes," exclaimed Luther, "God only
knows!" At the beginning of April there was a rumour of
an earthquake that had engulfed castles, cities, and whole
districts in Carinthia and Istria, and split the tower of St.
Mark at Venice into four parts. "If that is true," said the
Reformer, "these prodigies are the forerunners of the day of
Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> The astrologers declared that the aspect of
the quartiles of Saturn and Jupiter, and the general position
of the stars, was ominous.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The waters of the Elbe rolled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
thick and stormy, and stones fell from the roofs of churches.
"All these things," exclaimed the terrified Melancthon, "excite
me deeply."<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">OMENS.</div>

<p>The letters of convocation issued by the imperial government
agreed but too well with these prodigies. The Emperor,
writing from Toledo to the Elector, accused him of sedition
and revolt. Alarming whispers passed from mouth to
mouth that were sufficient to cause the fall of the weak.
Duke Henry of Mecklenburg and the Elector-palatine hastily
returned to the side of Popery.</p>

<p>Never had the sacerdotal party appeared in the diet in
such numbers, or so powerful and decided.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> On the 5th
March, Ferdinand, the president of the diet, after him the
Dukes of Bavaria, and lastly the ecclesiastical Electors of
Mentz and Treves, had entered the gates of Spire surrounded
by a numerous armed escort.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> On the 13th March, the
Elector of Saxony arrived, attended only by Melancthon and
Agricola. But Philip of Hesse, faithful to his character, entered
the city on the 18th March to the sound of trumpets,
and with two hundred horsemen.</p>

<p>The divergence of men's minds soon became manifest. A
Papist did not meet an Evangelical in the street without casting
angry glances upon him, and secretly threatening him
with perfidious machinations.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> The Elector-palatine passed
the Saxons without appearing to know them;<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> and although
John of Saxony was the most important of the electors, none
of the chiefs of the opposite party visited him. Grouped
around their tables, the Roman-catholic princes seemed absorbed
in games of hazard.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HOSTILITY OF THE PAPISTS.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>But erelong they gave positive marks of their hostile disposition.
The Elector and the Landgrave were prohibited
from having the Gospel preached in their mansions. It
was even asserted at this early period that John was about
to be turned out of Spire, and deprived of his electorate.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
"We are the execration and the sweepings of the world,"
said Melancthon; "but Christ will look down on his poor
people, and will preserve them."<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> In truth God was with
the witnesses to his Word. The people of Spire thirsted for
the Gospel, and the Elector wrote to his son on Palm Sunday:
"About eight thousand persons were present to-day in my
chapel at morning and evening worship."</p>

<p>The Roman party now quickened their proceedings: their
plan was simple but energetic. It was necessary to put down
the religious liberty that had existed for more than three
years, and for that purpose they must abrogate the decree of
1526, and revive that of 1521.</p>

<p>On the 15th March the imperial commissaries announced
to the diet that the last resolution of Spire, which left each
state free to act in conformity with the inspirations of its
conscience, having given rise to great disorders, the Emperor
had annulled it by virtue of his supreme power. This arbitrary
act, and which had no precedent in the Empire, as
well as the despotic tone with which it was accompanied, filled
the evangelical Christians with indignation and alarm.
"Christ," exclaimed Sturm, "has again fallen into the hands
of Caiaphas and Pilate."<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">RESOLUTIONS OF THE DIET.</div>

<p>A commission was charged to examine the imperial proposition.
The Archbishop of Salzburg, Faber, and Eck, that is
to say, the most violent enemies of the Reformation, were
among its members. "The Turks are better than the Lutherans,"
said Faber, "for the Turks observe fast-days and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Lutherans violate them.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> If we must choose between the
Holy Scriptures of God and the old errors of the Church,
we should reject the former."<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> "Every day in full assembly
Faber casts some new stone against the Gospellers," says Melancthon.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
"Oh, what an Iliad I should have to compose,"
added he, "if I were to report all these blasphemies!"</p>

<p>The priests called for the execution of the Edict of Worms,
1521, and the evangelical members of the commission, among
whom were the Elector of Saxony and Sturm, demanded on
the contrary the maintenance of the Edict of Spire, 1526.
The latter thus remained within the bounds of legality, whilst
their adversaries were driven to <i>coups d'état</i>. In fact, a new
order of things having been legally established in the Empire,
no one could infringe it; and if the diet presumed to
destroy by force what had been constitutionally established
three years before, the evangelical states had the right of opposing
it. The majority of the commission felt that the re-establishment
of the ancient order of things would be a revolution
no less complete than the Reformation itself. How could
they subject anew to Rome and to her clergy those nations
in whose bosom the Word of God had been so richly spread
abroad? For this reason, equally rejecting the demands of
the priests and of the Evangelicals, the majority came to a
resolution on the 24th March that every religious innovation
should continue to be interdicted in the places where the
Edict of Worms had been carried out; and that in those
where the people had deviated from it, and where they could
not conform to it without danger of revolt, they should at least
effect no new reform, they should touch upon no controverted
point, they should not oppose the celebration of the Mass,
they should permit no Roman catholic to embrace Lutheranism,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
they should not decline the Episcopal jurisdiction, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
should tolerate no Anabaptists or Sacramentarians. The status-quo
and no proselytism&mdash;such were the essentials of this
resolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE REFORMATION IN DANGER.</div>

<p>The majority no longer voted as in 1526: the wind had
turned against the Gospel. Accordingly this proposition, after
having been delayed a few days by the festival of Easter,
was laid before the diet on the 6th April, and passed on the
7th.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>If it became a law, the Reformation could neither be extended
into those places where as yet it was unknown, nor be
established on solid foundations in those where it already existed.
The re-establishment of the Romish hierarchy, stipulated
in the proposition, would infallibly bring back the ancient
abuses; and the least deviation from so vexatious an ordinance
would easily furnish the Romanists with a pretext
for completing the destruction of a work already so violently
shaken.</p>

<p>The Elector, the Landgrave, the Margrave of Brandenburg,
the Prince of Anhalt, and the Chancellor of Luneburg
on one side, and the deputies for the cities on the other, consulted
together. An entirely new order of things was to proceed
from this council. If they had been animated by selfishness,
they would perhaps have accepted this decree. In fact
they were left free, in appearance at least, to profess their
faith: ought they to demand more? could they do so? Were
they bound to constitute themselves the champions of liberty
of conscience in all the world? Never, perhaps, had there
been a more critical situation; but these noble-minded men
came victorious out of the trial. What! should they legalize
by anticipation the scaffold and the torture! Should they
oppose the Holy Ghost in its work of converting souls to
Christ! Should they forget their Master's command: "<i>Go
ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature</i>?"
If one of the states of the empire desired some day to follow
their example and be reformed, should they take away its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
power of doing so? Having themselves entered the kingdom
of heaven, should they shut the door after them? No! rather
endure everything, sacrifice everything, even their states, their
crowns, and their lives!</p>

<div class="sidenote">DECISION OF THE PRINCES.</div>

<p>"Let us reject this decree," said the princes. "In matters
of conscience the majority has no power."&mdash;"It is to the decree
of 1526," added the cities, "that we are indebted for the
peace that the empire enjoys: to abolish it would be to fill
Germany with troubles and divisions. The diet is incompetent
to do more than preserve religious liberty until a council
meets." Such in fact is the grand attribute of the state, and
if in our days the protestant powers should seek to influence
the Romish governments, they should strive solely to obtain
for the subjects of the latter that religious liberty which the
Pope confiscates to his own advantage wherever he reigns
alone, and by which he profits greatly in every evangelical
state. Some of the deputies proposed refusing all assistance
against the Turks, hoping thus to force the Emperor to interfere
in this question of religion. But Sturm called upon them
not to mingle political matters with the salvation of souls.
They resolved therefore to reject the proposition, but without
holding out any threats. It was this noble resolution that
gained for modern times liberty of thought and independence
of faith.</p>

<p>Ferdinand and the priests, who were no less resolute, determined
however on vanquishing what they called a daring
obstinacy; and they commenced with the weaker states.
They began to frighten and divide the cities, which had hitherto
pursued a common course. On the 12th April they were
summoned before the diet: in vain did they allege the absence
of some of their number, and ask for delay. It was refused,
and the call was hurried on. Twenty-one free cities accepted
the proposition of the diet, and fourteen rejected it. It
was a bold act on the part of the latter, and was accomplished
in the midst of the most painful sufferings. "This is the first
trial," said Pfarrer, second deputy of Strasburg; "now will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
come the second: we must either deny the Word of God or&mdash;be
burnt."<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">VIOLENCE OF FERDINAND.</div>

<p>A violent proceeding of Ferdinand immediately commenced
the series of humiliations that were reserved for the evangelical
cities. A deputy of Strasburg should, in conformity with
the decree of Worms, have been a member of the imperial
government from the commencement of April. He was declared
excluded from his rights, until the Mass should be re-established
in Strasburg. All the cities united in protesting
against this arbitrary act.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Elector-palatine and King Ferdinand
himself begged the princes to accept the decree, assuring
them that the Emperor would be exceedingly pleased with
them. "We will obey the Emperor," replied they calmly,
"in everything that may contribute to maintain peace and
the honour of God."</p>

<p>It was time to put an end to this struggle. On the 18th
April it was decreed that the evangelical states should not be
heard again; and Ferdinand prepared to inflict the decisive
blow on the morrow.</p>

<p>When the day came, the king appeared in the diet, surrounded
by the other commissaries of the Empire, and by
several bishops. He thanked the Roman catholics for their
fidelity, and declared that the resolution having been definitively
agreed to, it was about to be drawn up in the form of an
imperial decree. He then announced to the Elector and his
friends, that nothing more remained to them than to submit
to the majority.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SCHISM COMPLETED.</div>

<p>The evangelical princes, who had not expected so positive
a declaration, were excited at this summons, and passed, according
to custom, into an adjoining chamber to deliberate.
But Ferdinand was not in a humour to wait for their answer.
He rose, and all the imperial commissaries with him.
Vain were all endeavours to stop him. "I have received an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
order from his imperial majesty," replied he; "I have executed
it. All is over."</p>

<p>Thus Charles's brother notifies an order to the christian
princes, and then he retires without caring even if there was
any reply to make. To no purpose they sent a deputation entreating
the King to return. "It is a settled affair," repeated
Ferdinand; "submission is all that remains."<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> This refusal
completed the schism: it separated Rome from the Gospel.
Perhaps more justice on the part of the Empire and of the Papacy
might have prevented the rupture that since then has
divided the Western Church.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>VI. If the imperial party displayed such contempt, it was
not without a cause. They felt that weakness was on the
side of the Reformation, and strength on the side of Charles
and of the Pope. But the weak have also their strength;
and this the evangelical princes were aware of. As Ferdinand
paid no attention to their reclamations, it remained for
them to pay none to his absence, to appeal from the report
of the diet to the Word of God, and from the Emperor
Charles to Jesus Christ, the King of kings and Lord of
lords.</p>

<p>They resolved upon this step. A declaration was drawn
up to that effect, and this was the famous <i>Protest</i> that henceforward
gave the name of <i>Protestant</i> to the renovated Church.
The Elector and his allies having returned to the common
hall of the diet, thus addressed the assembled states:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PROTEST.</div>

<blockquote><p>"Dear Lords, Cousins, Uncles, and Friends! Having repaired
to this diet on the convocation of his majesty, and for
the common good of the Empire and of Christendom, we
have heard and learnt that the decisions of the last diet concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
our holy Christian Faith are to be repealed, and that
it is proposed to substitute for them restrictive and onerous
resolutions.</p>

<p>"King Ferdinand and the other imperial commissaries, by
affixing their seals to the last <i>Recess</i> of Spire, had promised,
however, in the name of the Emperor, to carry out sincerely
and inviolably all that it contained, and to permit nothing
that was contrary to it. In like manner, also, you and we,
electors, princes, prelates, lords, and deputies of the Empire,
bound ourselves to maintain always and with all our might
all the articles of this decree.</p>

<p>"We cannot therefore consent to its repeal.</p>

<p>"Firstly, because we believe that his imperial majesty, as
well as you and we, are called to maintain firmly what has
been unanimously and solemnly resolved.</p>

<p>"Secondly, because it concerns the glory of God and the
salvation of our souls, and that in such matters we ought to
have regard, above all, to the commandment of God, who
is King of kings and Lord of lords; each of us rendering him
account for himself, without caring the least in the world
about majority or minority.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>"We form no judgment on that which concerns you, most
dear lords; and we are content to pray God daily that he
will bring us all to unity of faith, in truth, charity, and
holiness through Jesus Christ, our Throne of Grace and our
only Mediator.</p>

<p>"But in what concerns us, adhesion to your resolution (and
let every honest man be judge!) would be acting against our
conscience, condemning a doctrine that we maintain to be
christian, and pronouncing that it ought to be abolished in our
states, if we could do so without trouble.</p>

<p>"This would be to deny our Lord Jesus Christ, to reject
his holy Word, and thus give him just reason to deny
us in turn before his Father, as he has threatened.</p>

<p>"What! we ratify this edict! We assert that when Almighty
God calls a man to His knowledge, this man cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
however receive the knowledge of God! Oh! of what deadly
backsliding should we not thus become the accomplices, not
only among our own subjects, but also among yours!</p>

<p>"For this reason we reject the yoke that is imposed on us.
And although it is universally known that in our states the
holy sacrament of the body and blood of our Lord is becomingly
administered, we cannot adhere to what the edict proposes
against the Sacramentarians, seeing that the imperial
edict did not speak of them, that they have not been heard,
and that we cannot resolve upon such important points before
the next council.</p>

<p>"Moreover"&mdash;and this is the essential part of the protest&mdash;"the
new edict declaring the ministers shall preach the Gospel,
explaining it according to the writings accepted by the
holy Christian Church; we think that, for this regulation to
have any value, we should first agree on what is meant by
this true and holy Church. Now, seeing that there is great
diversity of opinion in this respect; that there is no sure doctrine
but such as is conformable to the Word of God; that
the Lord forbids the teaching of any other doctrine; that each
text of the Holy Scriptures ought to be explained by other
and clearer texts; that this holy book is, in all things necessary
for the Christian, easy of understanding, and calculated
to scatter the darkness: we are resolved, with the grace of
God, to maintain the pure and exclusive preaching of his only
Word, such as it is contained in the biblical books of the Old
and New Testament, without adding anything thereto that
may be contrary to it.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> This Word is the only truth; it is
the sure rule of all doctrine and of all life, and can never fail
or deceive us. He who builds on this foundation shall stand
against all the powers of hell, whilst all the human vanities
that are set up against it shall fall before the face of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRINCIPLES OF THE PROTEST.</div>

<p>"For these reasons, most dear Lords, Uncles, Cousins, and
Friends, we earnestly entreat you to weigh carefully our
grievances and our motives. If you do not yield to our request,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
we <span class="smcap">Protest</span> by these presents, before God, our only
Creator, Preserver, Redeemer, and Saviour, and who will
one day be our Judge, as well as before all men and all creatures,
that we, for us and for our people, neither consent nor
adhere in any manner whatsoever to the proposed decree, in
any thing that is contrary to God, to his holy Word, to our
right conscience, to the salvation of our souls, and to the last
decree of Spire.</p>

<p>"At the same time we are in expectation that his imperial
majesty will behave towards us like a christian prince who
loves God above all things; and we declare ourselves ready
to pay unto him, as well as unto you, gracious lords, all the
affection and obedience that are our just and legitimate duty."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, in presence of the diet, spoke out those courageous
men whom Christendom will henceforward denominate <span class="smcap">The
Protestants</span>.</p>

<p>They had barely finished when they announced their intention
of quitting Spire on the morrow.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>This protest and declaration produced a deep impression.
The diet was rudely interrupted and broken into two hostile
parties,&mdash;thus preluding war. The majority became the prey
of the liveliest fears. As for the Protestants relying, <i>jure
humano</i>, upon the Edict of Spire, and <i>jure divino</i>, upon the Bible,
they were full of courage and firmness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SUPREMACY OF THE GOSPEL.</div>

<p>The principles contained in this celebrated protest of the
19th April 1529, constitute the very essence of Protestantism.
Now this protest opposes two abuses of man in matters of
faith: the first is the intrusion of the civil magistrate, and the
second is the arbitrary authority of the Church. Instead of
these two abuses, Protestantism sets up above the magistrate
the power of conscience; and above the visible Church the
authority of the Word of God. It declines, in the first place,
the civil power in divine things, and says with the Prophets
and Apostles: <i>We must obey God rather than man.</i> In presence
of the crown of Charles the Fifth, it uplifts the crown of
Jesus Christ. But it goes farther: it lays down the principle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
that all human teaching should be subordinate to the oracles
of God. Even the primitive Church, by recognising
the writings of the Apostles, had performed an act of submission
to this supreme authority, and not an act of authority,
as Rome maintains; and the establishment of a tribunal
charged with the interpretation of the Bible, had terminated
only in slavishly subjecting man to man in that which should
be the most unfettered&mdash;conscience and faith. In this celebrated
act of Spire no doctor appears, and the Word of God
reigns alone. Never has man exalted himself like the Pope;
never have men kept in the back-ground like the Reformers.</p>

<p>A Romish historian maintains that the word <i>Protestant</i> signifies
<i>enemy of the Emperor and of the Pope</i>.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> If by this it is
meant that Protestantism, in matters of faith, rejects the intervention
both of the Empire and of the Papacy, it is well.
Even this explanation, however, does not exhaust the meaning
of the word, for Protestantism rejected the authority of
man solely to place Jesus Christ on the throne of the Church,
and his Word in the pulpit. There has never been anything
more positive, and at the same time more aggressive,
than the position of the Protestants at Spire. By maintaining
that their faith is alone capable of saving the world, they defended
with intrepid courage the rights of Christian Proselytism.
We cannot abandon this Proselytism without deserting
the Protestant principle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FERDINAND REJECTS THE PROTEST.</div>

<p>The Protestants of Spire were not content to exalt the truth;
they defended charity. Faber and the other Papal partizans
had endeavoured to separate the princes, who in general
walked with Luther, from the cities that ranged themselves
rather on the side of Zwingle. &OElig;colampadius had immediately
written to Melancthon, and enlightened him on the
doctrines of the Zurich Reformer. He had indignantly rejected
the idea that Christ was banished into a corner of
heaven, and had energetically declared that, according to the
Swiss Christians, Christ was in every place upholding all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
things by the Word of his power.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> "With the visible symbols,"
he added, "we give and we receive the invisible grace,
like all the faithful."<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>These declarations were not useless. There were at Spire
two men who from different motives opposed the efforts of
Faber, and seconded those of &OElig;colampadius. The Landgrave,
ever revolving projects of alliance in his mind, felt
clearly that if the Christians of Saxony and of Hesse allowed
the condemnation of the Churches of Switzerland and of
Upper Germany, they would by that very means deprive
themselves of powerful auxiliaries.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Melancthon, who was
far from desiring, as the Landgrave, a diplomatic alliance,
for fear that it would hasten on a war, defended the great principles
of justice, and exclaimed: "To what just reproaches
should we not be exposed, were we to recognise in our adversaries
the right of condemning a doctrine without having
heard those who defend it!" The union of all evangelical
Christians is therefore a principle of primitive Protestantism.</p>

<p>As Ferdinand had not heard the protest of the 19th April,
a deputation of the evangelical states went the next day to
present it to him. The brother of Charles the Fifth received
it at first, but immediately after desired to return it. Then
was witnessed a strange scene&mdash;the king refusing to keep the
protest, and the deputies to take it back. At last the latter,
from respect, received it from Ferdinand's hands; but they
laid it boldly upon a table, and directly quitted the hall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JOY OF THE PROTESTANTS.</div>

<p>The king and the imperial commissaries remained in presence
of this formidable writing. It was there&mdash;before their
eyes&mdash;a significant monument of the courage and faith of
the Protestants. Irritated against this silent but mighty witness,
which accused his tyranny, and left him the responsibility
of all the evils that were about to burst upon the Empire,
the brother of Charles the Fifth called some of his councillors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and ordered them instantly to carry back this important
document to the Protestants.</p>

<p>All this was unavailing; the protest had been enregistered
in the annals of the world, and nothing could erase it. Liberty
of thought and of conscience had been conquered for ages
to come. Thus all evangelical Germany, foreseeing these
things, was moved at this courageous act, and adopted it as
the expression of its will and of its faith. Men in every
quarter beheld in it not a political event, but a christian action,
and the youthful electoral prince, John Frederick, in this respect
the organ of his age, cried to the Protestants of Spire:
"May the Almighty, who has given you grace to confess energetically,
freely, and fearlessly, preserve you in that christian
firmness until the day of eternity!"<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>While the christians were filled with joy, their enemies
were frightened at their own work. The very day on which
Ferdinand had declined to receive the protest, Tuesday, 20th
April, at one in the afternoon, Henry of Brunswick and
Philip of Baden presented themselves as mediators, announcing,
however, that they were acting solely of their own authority.
They proposed that there should be no more mention
of the decree of Worms, and that the first decree of Spire
should be maintained, but with a few modifications; that the
two parties, while remaining free until the next council,
should oppose every new sect, and tolerate no doctrine contrary
to the sacrament of the Lord's body.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">EXULTATION OF THE PAPISTS.</div>

<p>On Wednesday, 21st April, the evangelical states did not
appear adverse to these propositions; and even those who had
embraced the doctrine of Zwingle declared boldly that such
a proposal would not compromise their existence. "Only
let us call to mind," said they, "that in such difficult matters
we must act, not with the sword, but with the sure Word
of God.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> For, as Saint Paul says: <i>What is not of faith is</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
<i>sin</i>. If therefore we constrain Christians to do what they
believe unjust, instead of leading them by God's Word
to acknowledge what is good, we force them to sin, and we
incur a terrible responsibility."</p>

<p>The fanatics of the Roman party trembled as they saw
the victory nearly escaping from them; for they rejected all
compromise, and desired purely and simply the re-establishment
of the Papacy. Their zeal overcame everything, and
the negotiations were broken off.</p>

<p>On Thursday, 22d April, the diet assembled at seven in
the morning, and the <i>Recess</i> was read precisely as it had
been drawn up before, without even mentioning the attempt
at conciliation which had just failed.</p>

<p>Faber triumphed. Proud of having the ear of kings, he
tossed himself furiously about, and one would have said, to
see him, relates an eye-witness, that he was a Cyclops forging
in his cavern the monstrous chains with which he was about
to bind the Reform and the Reformers.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> The Papist princes,
carried away by the tumult, gave the spur, says Melancthon,
and flung themselves headlong into a path filled with dangers.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
Nothing was left for the evangelical Christians but
to fall on their knees and cry to the Lord. "All that remains
for us to do," repeated Melancthon, "is to call upon the Son
of God."<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>The last sitting of the diet took place on the 24th April.
The princes renewed their protest, in which fourteen free
and imperial cities joined: and they next thought of giving
their appeal a legal form.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRISTIAN UNITY A REALITY.</div>

<p>On Sunday, 25th April, two notaries, Leonard Stetner of
Freysingen and Pangrace Saltzmann of Bamberg, were seated
before a small table in a narrow chamber on the ground-floor
of a house situated in St. John's Lane, near the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of the same name in Spire, and around them were the chancellors
of the princes and of the evangelical cities, assisted by
several witnesses.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>This little house belonged to an humble pastor, Peter Muterstatt,
deacon of St. John's, who, taking the place of the
Elector or of the Landgrave, had offered a domicile for the
important act that was preparing. His name shall in consequence
be transmitted to posterity. The document having
been definitively drawn up, one of the notaries began reading
it. "Since there is a natural communion between all men,"
said the Protestants, "and since even persons condemned to
death are permitted to unite and appeal against their condemnation;
how much more are we, who are members of the
same spiritual body, the Church of the Son of God, children
of the same heavenly Father, and consequently brothers in
the Spirit,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> authorized to unite when our salvation and eternal
condemnation are concerned."</p>

<p>After reviewing all that had passed in the diet, and after intercalating
in their appeal the principal documents that had
reference to it, the Protestants ended by saying: "We therefore
appeal for ourselves, for our subjects, and for all who
receive or who shall hereafter receive the Word of God, from
all past, present, or future vexatious measures, to his Imperial
Majesty, and to a free and universal assembly of holy Christendom."
This document filled twelve sheets of parchment;
the signatures and seals were affixed to the thirteenth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ESCAPE OF GRYNÆUS.</div>

<p>Thus in the obscure dwelling of the chaplain of St. John's
was made the first confession of the true Christian union. In
presence of the holy mechanical unity of the Pope, these confessors
of Jesus raised the banner of the living unity of Christ;
and, as in the days of our Saviour, if there were many synagogues
in Israel, there was at least but one single temple.
The Christians of Electoral Saxony, of Luneburg, of Anhalt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of Hesse and the Margravate, of Strasburg, Nuremberg,
Ulm, Constance, Lindau, Memmingen, Kempten, Nordlingen,
Heilbron, Reutlingen, Isny, Saint Gall, Weissenburg,
and Windsheim, clasped each other's hands on the 25th
April, near the church of St. John, in the face of threatening
persecutions. Among them might be found those who, like
Zwingle, acknowledged in the Lord's Supper the entirely
spiritual presence of Jesus Christ, as well as those who, like
Luther, admitted his corporeal presence. There existed not
at that time in the evangelical body any sects, hatred, or
schism; christian unity was a reality. That upper chamber
in which, during the early days of Christianity, the apostles
with the women and the brethren "continued with one accord
in prayer and supplication,"<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> and that lower chamber
where, in the first days of the Reformation, the renewed disciples
of Jesus Christ presented themselves to the Pope and
the Emperor, to the world and to the scaffold, as forming
but one body, are the two cradles of the Church; and it is in
this its hour of weakness and humiliation that it shines forth
with the brightest glory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MELANCTHON'S DEJECTION.</div>

<p>After this appeal each one returned silently to his dwelling.
Several tokens excited alarm for the safety of the Protestants.
A short time previously Melancthon hastily conducted through
the streets of Spire towards the Rhine his friend Simon
Grynæus, pressing him to cross the river. The latter was
astonished at such precipitation.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> "An old man of grave
and solemn appearance, but who is unknown to me," said
Melancthon, "appeared before me and said: In a minute
officers of justice will be sent by Ferdinand to arrest Grynæus."
As he was intimate with Faber, and had been scandalized
at one of his sermons, Grynæus had gone to him,
and begged him no longer to make war against the truth.
Faber had dissembled his anger, but immediately after repaired
to the king, from whom he had obtained an order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
against the importunate professor of Heidelberg.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Melancthon
doubted not that God had saved his friend by sending one
of His holy angels to forewarn him. Motionless on the banks
of the Rhine he waited until the waters of that stream had
rescued Grynæus from his persecutors. "At last," cried Melancthon,
as he saw him on the opposite side, "he is torn
from the cruel teeth of those who drink innocent blood."<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
When he returned to his house, Melancthon was informed
that the officers in search of Grynæus had ransacked it from
top to bottom.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>Nothing could detain the Protestants longer in Spire. Accordingly,
on the morning after their appeal (Monday, 26th
April), the Elector, the Landgrave, and the Dukes of Luneburg,
quitted the city, reached Worms, and then returned by
Hesse into their own states. The appeal of Spire was published
by the Landgrave on the 5th, and by the Elector on
the 13th May.</p>

<p>Melancthon had returned to Wittemberg on the 6th May,
persuaded that the two parties were about to draw the sword.
His friends were alarmed at seeing him agitated, exhausted,
and like one dead.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> "It is a great event that has just taken
place at Spire," said he. "It is big with dangers, not only to
the Empire, but also to Religion itself.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> All the pains of hell
oppress me."<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PRINCES, THE TRUE REFORMERS.</div>

<p>It was Melancthon's greatest affliction, that all these evils
were attributed to him, as indeed he ascribed them himself.
"One single thing has injured us," said he; "our not having
approved, as was required of us, the edict against the Zwinglians."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Luther did not take this gloomy view of affairs;
but he was far from comprehending the force of the protest.
"The diet," said he, "has come to an end almost without
results, except that those who scourge Jesus Christ have not
been able to satisfy their fury."<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>Posterity has not ratified this decision, and, on the contrary,
dating from this epoch the definitive formation of Protestantism,
it has hailed in the Protest of Spire one of the
greatest movements recorded in history.</p>

<p>Let us see to whom the chief glory of this act belongs.
The part taken by the princes, and especially by the Elector
of Saxony, in the German Reformation, must strike every
impartial observer. These are the true Reformers&mdash;the true
Martyrs. The Holy Ghost, that bloweth where it listeth, had
inspired them with the courage of the ancient confessors of
the Church; and the God of Election was glorified in
them. A little later perhaps this great part played by the
princes might have produced deplorable consequences: there
is no grace of God that man may not pervert. But nothing
should prevent us from rendering honour to whom honour is
due, and from adoring the work of the eternal Spirit in these
eminent men who, under God, were in the sixteenth century
the saviours of Christendom.</p>

<p>The Reformation had taken a bodily form. It was Luther
alone who had said No at the Diet of Worms: but
Churches and ministers, princes and people, said No at the
Diet of Spire.</p>

<p>In no country had superstition, scholasticism, hierarchy,
and popery, been so powerful as among the Germanic nations.
These simple and candid people had humbly bent
their neck to the yoke that came from the banks of the Tiber.
But, there was in them a depth, a life, a need of interior
liberty, which, sanctified by the Word of God, might render
them the most energetic organs of christian truth. It
was from them that was destined to emanate the reaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
against that material, external, and legal system, which had
taken the place of Christianity; it was they who were called
to shatter in pieces the skeleton which had been substituted for
the spirit and the life, and restore to the heart of Christendom,
ossified by the hierarchy, the generous beatings of which it
had been deprived for so many ages. The Universal Church
will never forget the debt it owes to the Princes of Spire and
to Luther.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<div class="sidenote">GERMANY AND REFORM.</div>

<p>VII. The protest of Spire had still further increased the indignation
of the Papal adherents; and Charles the Fifth, according
to the oath he had made at Barcelona, set about
preparing "a suitable antidote for the pestilential disease with
which the Germans were attacked, and to avenge in a striking
manner the insult offered to Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> The Pope,
on his part, endeavoured to combine all the other princes of
Christendom in this crusade; and the peace of Cambray, concluded
on the 5th August, tended to the accomplishment of
his cruel designs. It left the Emperor's hands free against
the heretics. After having entered their protest at Spire, it
was necessary for the Evangelicals to think of maintaining it.</p>

<p>The Protestant states that had already laid the foundations
of an evangelical alliance at Spire, had agreed to send
deputies to Rothach; but the Elector, staggered by the representations
of Luther, who was continually saying to him,
"It is by keeping yourselves tranquil and in quietness that
you will be saved,"<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> ordered his deputies to listen to the propositions
of his allies, but to decide upon nothing. They adjourned
to a new conference, which never took place. Luther
triumphed; for human alliances failed. "Christ the
Lord will know how to deliver us without the Landgrave,
and even against the Landgrave," said he to his friends.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">DIFFICULTY OF UNION.</div>

<p>Philip of Hesse, who was vexed at Luther's obstinacy, was
convinced that it arose from a dispute about words. "They
will hear no mention of alliances because of the Zwinglians,"
said he; "well then, let us put an end to the contradictions
that separate them from Luther."</p>

<p>The union of all the disciples of the Word of God seemed
in fact a necessary condition to the success of the Reform.
How could the Protestants resist the power of Rome and of
the Empire, if they were divided? The Landgrave no doubt
wished to unite their minds, that he might afterwards be able
to unite their arms; but the cause of Christ was not to triumph
by the sword. If they should succeed in uniting their
hearts and prayers, the Reform would then find such strength
in the faith of its children, that Philip's spearmen would no
longer be necessary.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this union of minds, that was now to be
sought after above all things, was a very difficult task. Luther
in 1519 had at first appeared not only to reform, but entirely
renovate the doctrine of the Lord's Supper, as the Swiss
did somewhat later. "I go to the sacrament of the Lord's
Supper," he had said, "and I there receive a sign from God
that Christ's righteousness and passion justify me; such is the
use of the Sacrament."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> This discourse, which had gone
through several impressions in the cities of Upper Germany,
had prepared men's minds for the doctrine of Zwingle. Accordingly
Luther, astonished at the reputation he had gained,
published this solemn declaration in 1527: "I protest before
God and before the whole world that I have never walked
with the Sacramentarians."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A LUTHERAN WARNING.</div>

<p>Luther in fact was never Zwinglian as regards the Communion.
Far from that, in 1519, he still believed in Transubstantiation.
Why then should he speak of a sign? It
was for this reason. While, according to Zwingle, the bread
and wine are signs of the body and blood of Christ, according
to Luther, the very body and blood of Jesus Christ are signs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of God's grace. These opinions are widely different from
one another.</p>

<p>Erelong this disagreement declared itself. In 1527 Zwingle
in his <i>Friendly Exposition</i><a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> repeated Luther's opinion
with mildness and respect. Unfortunately the pamphlet of
the Saxon Reformer "against the enthusiasts" was then issuing
from the press, and in it Luther expressed his indignation
that his adversaries should dare to speak of christian unity
and peace. "Well!" exclaimed he, "since they thus insult
all reason, I will give them a Lutheran warning.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Cursed
be this concord! cursed be this charity! down, down with it,
to the bottomless pit of hell! If I should murder your father,
your mother, your wife, your child, and then, wishing to murder
you, I should say to you, Let us be at peace, my dear
friend! what answer would you make?&mdash;It is thus that the
enthusiasts who murder Jesus Christ my Lord, God the Father,
and Christendom my mother, wish to murder me also;
and then they say, Let us be friends!"</p>

<p>Zwingle wrote two replies "to the excellent Martin Luther,"
in a cold tone and with a haughty calmness more difficult to
pardon than the invectives of the Saxon doctor. "We ought
to esteem you a vessel of honour, and we do so with joy," said
he, "notwithstanding your faults." Pamphlet followed pamphlet,
Luther always writing with the same impetuosity, and
Zwingle with the same coolness and irony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROPOSED CONFERENCE AT MARBURG.</div>

<p>Such were the doctors whom the Landgrave undertook to
reconcile. Already, during the sitting of the Diet of Spire,
Philip of Hesse, who was afflicted at hearing the Papists
continually repeating, "You boast of your attachment to the
pure Word of God, and yet you are nevertheless disunited,"<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
had made overtures to Zwingle in writing. He now went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
farther, and invited the theologians of the different parties to
meet at Marburg. These invitations met with various receptions.
Zwingle, whose heart was large and fraternal, answered
the Landgrave's call; but Luther, who discovered
leagues and battles behind this pretended concord, rejected it.</p>

<p>It seemed, however, that great difficulties would detain
Zwingle. To travel from Zurich to Marburg, it was necessary
to pass through the territories of the Emperor and of
other enemies to the Reformation; the Landgrave himself did
not conceal the dangers of the journey;<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> but in order to obviate
these difficulties, he promised an escort from Strasburg to
Hesse, and for the rest "the protection of God."<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> These
precautions were not of a nature to reassure the Zurichers.</p>

<p>Reasons of another kind detained Luther and Melancthon.
"It is not right," said they, "that the Landgrave has so much
to do with the Zwinglians. Their error is of such a nature
that people of acute minds are easily tainted by it. Reason
loves what it understands, particularly when learned men
clothe their ideas in a scriptural dress."</p>

<p>Melancthon did not stop here, but put forth the very extraordinary
notion of selecting Papists as judges of the discussion.
"If there were no impartial judges," said he, "the Zwinglians
would have a good chance of boasting of victory."<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Thus,
according to Melancthon, Papists would be impartial judges
when the real presence was the subject of discussion! He
went still farther. "Let the Elector," he wrote on the 14th
May to the Prince Electoral, "refuse to permit our journey
to Marburg, so that we may allege this excuse." The Elector
would not lend himself to so disgraceful a proceeding;
and the Reformers of Wittemberg found themselves compelled
to accede to the request of Philip of Hesse. But they did
so with these words: "If the Swiss do not yield to us, all
your trouble will be lost;" and they wrote to the theologians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
among their friends who were convoked by the Prince:
"Stay away if you can; your absence will be very useful to
us."<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE'S DEPARTURE.</div>

<p>Zwingle, on the contrary, who would have gone to the end
of the world, made every exertion to obtain from the magistrates
of Zurich permission to visit Marburg. "I am convinced,"
said he to the secret council, "that if we doctors
meet face to face, the splendour of truth will illuminate our
eyes."<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> But the council that had only just signed the first
religious peace,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> and who feared to see war burst out afresh,
positively refused to allow the departure of the Reformer.</p>

<p>Upon this Zwingle decided for himself. He felt that his
presence was necessary for the maintenance of peace in
Zurich; but it was the welfare of all Christendom that
summoned him to Marburg. Accordingly, raising his eyes
towards heaven, he resolved to depart, exclaiming, "O God!
Thou hast never abandoned us; Thou wilt perform thy will
for thine own glory."<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> During the night of the 31st August,
Zwingle, who was unwilling to wait for the Landgrave's safe-conduct,
prepared for his journey. Rodolph Collin, the Greek
professor, was alone to accompany him. The Reformer
wrote to the Smaller and to the Great Council: "If I leave
without informing you, it is not because I despise your authority,
most wise lords; but because, knowing the love you
bear towards me, I foresee that your anxiety will oppose my
going."</p>

<div class="sidenote">RUMOURS IN ZURICH.</div>

<p>As he was writing these words, a fourth message arrived
from the Landgrave, more pressing still than the preceding
ones. The Reformer sent the prince's letter to the
burgomaster with his own; he then quitted his house privily
by night,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> concealing his departure both from his friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
whose importunity he feared, and from his enemies, whose
snares he had good cause to dread. He did not even tell his
wife where he was going, lest it should distress her. He
and Collin then mounted two horses that had been hired for
the purpose,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> and rode off rapidly in the direction of Basle.</p>

<p>During the day the rumour of Zwingle's absence spread
through Zurich, and his enemies were elated. "He has fled
the country," said they; "he has run away with a pack of
scoundrels!" "As he was crossing the river at Bruck," said
others, "the boat upset and he was drowned." "The devil,"
affirmed many with a malicious smile, "appeared to him
bodily and carried him off."<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>&mdash;"There was no end to their
stories," says Bullinger. But the council immediately resolved
on acceding to the wish of the Reformer. On the very
day of his departure they appointed one of the councillors,
Ulric Funck, to accompany him to Marburg, who forthwith
set out with a domestic and one arquebusier. Strasburg and
Basle in like manner sent statesmen in company with their
theologians, under the idea that this conference would doubtless
have also a political object.</p>

<p>Zwingle arrived safe and sound at Basle,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> and embarked
on the river on the 6th September with &OElig;colampadius and
several merchants.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> In thirteen hours they reached Strasburg,
where the two Reformers lodged in the house of Matthew
Zell, the cathedral preacher. Catherine, the pastor's wife, prepared
the dishes in the kitchen, waited at table, according to
the ancient German manners,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> and then sitting down near
Zwingle, listened attentively, and spoke with so much piety
and knowledge, that the latter soon ranked her above many
doctors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE REFORMERS AT MARBURG.</div>

<p>Zwingle, after discussing with the Strasburg magistrates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the means of resisting the Romish league, and the organization
to be given to the christian confederacy,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> quitted Strasburg;
and he and his friends, conducted along by-roads,
through forests, over mountains and valleys, by secret but
sure paths, at last arrived at Marburg, escorted by forty Hessian
cavaliers.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>Luther, on his side, accompanied by Melancthon, Cruciger,
and Jonas, had stopped on the Hessian frontier, declaring that
nothing should induce him to cross it until he had a safe-conduct
from the Landgrave. This document being obtained,
Luther arrived at Alsfeld, where the scholars, kneeling under
the Reformer's windows, chanted their pious hymns. He entered
Marburg on the 30th September, a day after the arrival
of the Swiss. Both parties went to inns; but they had scarcely
alighted, before the Landgrave invited them to come and
lodge in the castle, thinking by this means to bring the opposing
parties closer together. Philip entertained them in a
manner truly royal.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> "Ah!" said the pious Jonas, as he
wandered through the halls of the palace, "it is not in honour
of the Muses, but in honour of God and of his Christ, that we
are so munificently treated in these forests of Hesse!" After
dinner, on the first day, &OElig;colampadius, Hedio, and Bucer,
desirous of entering into the prince's views, went and saluted
Luther. The latter conversed affectionately with &OElig;colampadius
in the castle-court; but Bucer, with whom he had once
been very intimate, and who was now on Zwingle's side,
having approached him, Luther said to him, smiling, and
making a sign with his hand: "As for you, you are a good-for-nothing
fellow and a knave!"<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PRELIMINARY DISCUSSIONS.</div>

<p>The unhappy Carlstadt, who had begun all this dispute,
was at that time in Friesland, preaching the spiritual presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of Christ, and living in such destitution that he had been forced
to sell his Hebrew Bible to procure bread. The trial had
crushed his pride, and he wrote to the Landgrave: "We are
but one body, one house, one people, one sacerdotal race; we
live and die by one and the same Saviour.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> For this reason,
I, poor and in exile, humbly pray your highness, by the blood
of Jesus Christ, to allow me to be present at this disputation."</p>

<p>But how bring Luther and Carlstadt face to face? and yet
how repel the unhappy man? The Landgrave, to extricate
himself from this difficulty, referred him to the Saxon Reformer.
Carlstadt did not appear.</p>

<p>Philip of Hesse desired that, previously to the public conference,
the theologians should have a private interview. It
was however considered dangerous, says a contemporary, for
Zwingle and Luther, who were both naturally violent, to contend
with one another at the very beginning; and as &OElig;colampadius
and Melancthon were the mildest, they were apportioned
to the roughest.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> On Friday the 1st October, after
divine service, Luther and &OElig;colampadius were conducted
into one chamber, and Zwingle and Melancthon into another.
The combatants were then left to struggle two and two.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MELANCTHON AND ZWINGLE.</div>

<p>The principal contest took place in the room of Zwingle
and Melancthon. "It is affirmed," said Melancthon to Zwingle,
"that some among you speak of God after the manner
of the Jews, as if Christ was not essentially God." "I think
on the Holy Trinity," replied Zwingle, "with the Council of
Nice and the Athanasian creed." "Councils! creeds! What
does that mean?" asked Melancthon. "Have you not continually
repeated that you recognise no other authority than
that of Scripture?" "We have never rejected the councils,"
replied the Swiss Reformer, "when they are based on the
authority of the Word of God.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> The four first councils are
truly sacred as regards doctrine, and none of the faithful have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
ever rejected them." This important declaration, handed
down to us by &OElig;colampadius, characterizes the Reformed
theology.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>"But you teach," resumed Melancthon, "like Thomas
Munster, that the Holy Ghost acts quite alone, independently
of the sacraments and of the Word of God." "The
Holy Ghost," replied Zwingle, "works in us justification by
the Word, but by the Word preached and understood, by
the soul and the marrow of the Word, by the mind and will
of God clothed in human language."<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>"At least," continued Melancthon, "you deny original sin,
and make sin to consist only in actual and external works, like
the Pelagians, the philosophers, and the Papists."</p>

<p>This was the principal difficulty. "Since man naturally
loves himself," replied Zwingle, "instead of loving God; in
that there is a crime, a sin that condemns him."<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> He had
more than once before expressed the same opinion;<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> and yet
Melancthon exulted on hearing him: "Our adversaries," said
he afterwards, "have given way on all these points!"</p>

<p>Luther had pursued the same method with &OElig;colampadius
as Melancthon with Zwingle. The discussion had in particular
turned on baptism. Luther complained that they
would not acknowledge that by this simple sign a man became
a member of the Church. "It is true," said &OElig;colampadius,
"that we require faith&mdash;either an actual or a future
faith. Why should we deny it? Who is a Christian,
if it be not he who believes in Christ? However, I should
be unwilling to deny that the water of baptism is in a certain
sense a water of regeneration; for by it he whom the
Church knew not becomes its child."<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>
<p>These four theologians were in the very heat of their
discussions, when domestics came to inform them that the
prince's dinner was on the table. They immediately rose,
and Zwingle and Melancthon meeting Luther and &OElig;colampadius,
who were also quitting their chamber, the latter
approached Zwingle, and whispered mournfully in his ear:
"I have fallen a second time into the hands of Dr. Eck."<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
In the language of the Reformers nothing stronger could be
said.</p>

<p>It does not appear that the conference between Luther and
&OElig;colampadius was resumed after dinner. Luther's manner
held out little hope; but Melancthon and Zwingle returned
to the discussion, and the Zurich doctor finding the Wittemberg
professor escape him like an eel, as he said, and
take "like Proteus a thousand different forms," seized a pen
in order to fix his antagonist. Zwingle committed to writing
whatever Melancthon dictated, and then wrote his reply, giving
it to the other to read.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> In this manner they spent six
hours, three in the morning and three in the afternoon.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
They prepared for the general conference.</p>

<p>Zwingle requested that it should be an open one; Luther
opposed this. It was resolved that the princes, nobles, deputies,
and theologians should be admitted; but a great crowd
of citizens, and even many scholars and gentlemen, who had
come from Frankfort, from the Rhine districts, from Strasburg,
from Basle and other Swiss towns, were excluded.
Brenz speaks of fifty or sixty hearers; Zwingle of twenty-four
only.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">OPENING OF THE CONFERENCE.</div>

<p>On a gentle elevation, watered by the Lahn, is situated an
old castle, overlooking the city of Marburg; in the distance is
seen the beautiful valley of the Lahn, and beyond, the mountain-tops
rising one above another, until they are lost in the
horizon. It was beneath the vaults and Gothic arches of an
ancient hall in this castle, called the Knights' Hall, that the
conference was to take place.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning (2d October) the Landgrave took his
seat in the hall, surrounded by his court, but so plainly
dressed that no one would have taken him for a prince.
He wished to avoid the appearance of playing the part of a
Constantine in the affairs of the Church. Before him was a
table which Luther, Zwingle, Melancthon, and &OElig;colampadius
approached. Luther, taking a piece of chalk, bent over
the velvet cloth which covered it, and steadily wrote four
words in large characters. All eyes followed the movement
of his hand, and soon they read <span class="smcap">Hoc est Corpus Meum</span>.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
Luther wished to have this declaration continually before him,
that it might strengthen his faith, and be a sign to his adversaries.</p>

<p>Behind these four theologians were seated their friends,&mdash;Hedio,
Sturm, Funck, Frey, Eberard, Than, Jonas, Cruigerc,
and others besides. Jonas cast an inquiring glance upon the
Swiss: "Zwingle," said he, "has a certain rusticity and arrogance;<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
if he is well versed in letters, it is in spite of Minerva
and of the Muses. In &OElig;colampadius there is a natural
goodness and admirable meekness. Hedio seems to have as
much liberality as kindness; but I find in Bucer the cunning
of a fox, that knows how to give himself an air of sense and
prudence." Men of moderate sentiments often meet with
worse treatment than those of the extreme parties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADDRESS OF CORDUE.</div>

<p>Other sentiments animated those who contemplated this
assembly from a distance. The great men who had led the
people in their footsteps on the plains of Saxony, on the banks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of the Rhine, and in the lofty valleys of Switzerland, were
there met face to face: the Chiefs of Christendom, separated
from Rome, were come together to see if they could remain
one. Accordingly, from all parts of Germany, prayers and
anxious looks were directed towards Marburg. "Illustrious
princes of the Word,"<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> cried the evangelical Church through
the mouth of the poet Cordus, "penetrating Luther, mild
&OElig;colampadius, magnanimous Zwingle, pious Snepf, eloquent
Melancthon, courageous Bucer, candid Hedio, excellent Osiander,
valiant Brenz, amiable Jonas, fiery Craton, Mænus,
whose soul is stronger than his body, great Dionysius, and
you Myconius&mdash;all you whom Prince Philip, that illustrious
hero, has summoned, ministers and bishops, whom the christian
cities have sent to terminate the schism, and to show us
the way of truth; the suppliant Church falls weeping at your
feet, and begs you by the bowels of Jesus Christ to bring this
matter to a happy issue, so that the world may acknowledge
in your resolution the work of the Holy Ghost himself."<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>The Landgrave's chancellor, John Feige, having reminded
them in the prince's name that the object of this colloquy
was the re-establishment of union, "I protest," said
Luther, "that I differ from my adversaries with regard to
the doctrine of the Lord's Supper, and that I shall always differ
from them. Christ has said, <i>This is my body</i>. Let them
show me that a body is not a body. I reject reason, common
sense, carnal arguments, and mathematical proofs. God
is above mathematics.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> We have the Word of God; we
must adore it and perform it!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DISCUSSION&mdash;FIGURES.</div>

<p>"It cannot be denied," said &OElig;colampadius, "that there are
figures of speech in the Word of God; as <i>John is Elias, the
rock was Christ, I am the vine</i>. The expression <i>This is my
body</i>, is a figure of the same kind." Luther granted that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
there were figures in the Bible, but he denied that this last
expression was figurative.</p>

<p>All the various parties, however, of which the Christian
Church is composed see a figure in these words. In fact, the
Romanists declare that <i>This is my body</i> signifies not only "my
body," but also "my blood," "my soul," and even "my Divinity,"
and "Christ wholly.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>" These words, therefore, according
to Rome, are a synecdoche, a figure by which a part
is taken for the whole. And, as regards the Lutherans, the
figure is still more evident.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Whether it be synecdoche, metaphor,
or metonymy, there is still a figure. In order to prove
it, &OElig;colampadius employed this syllogism:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What Christ rejected in the sixth chapter of St. John,
he could not admit in the words of the Eucharist.</p>

<p>"Now Christ, who said to the people of Capernaum, <i>The
flesh profiteth nothing</i>, rejected by those very words the oral
manducation of his body.</p>

<p>"Therefore he did not establish it at the institution of his
Supper."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"I deny the minor (the second of these propositions);
Christ has not rejected all oral manducation, but only
a material manducation, like that of the flesh of oxen or of
swine."<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">&OElig;colampadius.</span>&mdash;"There is danger in attributing too much
to mere matter."</p>

<div class="sidenote">SCRIPTURE EXPLAINED BY SCRIPTURE.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"Every thing that God commands becomes
spirit and life. If it is by the Lord's order that we lift up a
straw, in that very action we perform a spiritual work. We
must pay attention to him who speaks, and not to what he
says. God speaks: Men, worms, listen!&mdash;God commands:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
let the world obey! and let us all together fall down and
humbly kiss the Word."<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">&OElig;colampadius.</span>&mdash;"But since we have the spiritual eating,
what need of the bodily one?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"I do not ask what need we have of it; but I
see it written, <i>Eat, this is my body</i>. We must therefore believe
and do. We must do&mdash;we must do!<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>&mdash;If God should
order me to eat dung, I would do it, with the assurance that
it would be salutary."<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>At this point Zwingle interfered in the discussion. "We
must explain Scripture by Scripture," said he. "We cannot
admit two kinds of corporeal manducation, as if Jesus had
spoken of eating, and the Capernaites of tearing in pieces, for
the same word is employed in both cases. Jesus says that to
eat his flesh corporeally profiteth nothing (John vi. 63);
whence it would result that he had given us in the Supper
a thing that would be useless to us.&mdash;Besides there are certain
words that seem to me rather childish,&mdash;the dung, for
instance. The oracles of the demons were obscure, not so are
those of Jesus Christ."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"When Christ says the flesh profiteth nothing,
he speaks not of his own flesh, but of ours."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Zwingle.</span>&mdash;"The soul is fed with the Spirit and not with
the flesh."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"It is with the mouth that we eat the body; the
soul does not eat it."<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zwingle.</span>&mdash;"Christ's body is therefore a corporeal nourishment,
and not a spiritual."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"You are captious."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zwingle.</span>&mdash;"Not so; but you utter contradictory things."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"If God should present me wild apples, I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
eat them spiritually. In the Eucharist, the mouth receives
the body of Christ, and the soul believes in his words."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SPIRITUAL EATING.</div>

<p>Zwingle then quoted a great number of passages from the
Holy Scripture, in which the sign is described by the very
thing signified; and thence concluded that, considering our
Lord's declaration in St. John, <i>The flesh profiteth nothing</i>, we
must explain the words of the Eucharist in a similar manner.</p>

<p>Many hearers were struck by these arguments. Among
the Marburg professors sat the Frenchman Lambert; his tall
and spare frame was violently agitated. He had been at first

two Reformers. As he went to the conference, he said: "I
desire to be a sheet of blank paper, on which the finger of
God may write his truth." Ere long he exclaimed, after hearing
Zwingle and &OElig;colampadius: "Yes! the Spirit, that is
what vivifies!"<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> When this conversion was known, the
Wittembergers, shrugging their shoulders, said, "Gallic fickleness!"
"What!" replied Lambert, "was St. Paul fickle
because he was converted from Pharisaism? And have we
ourselves been fickle in abandoning the lost sects of Popery?"</p>

<p>Luther was, however, by no means shaken. "<i>This is
my body</i>," repeated he, pointing with his finger to the words
written before him. "<i>This is my body.</i> The devil himself
shall not drive me from that. To seek to understand it, is to
fall away from the faith."<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>"But, doctor," said Zwingle, "St. John explains how
Christ's body is eaten, and you will be obliged at last to leave
off singing always the same song."</p>

<div class="sidenote">AGITATION IN THE CONFERENCE.</div>

<p>"You make use of unmannerly expressions," replied Luther<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>.
The Wittembergers themselves called Zwingle's argument
"his old song."<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Zwingle continued without being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
disconcerted: "I ask you, doctor, whether Christ in the sixth
chapter of St. John did not wish to reply to the question that
had been put to him?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"Mr. Zwingle, you wish to stop my mouth by
the arrogancy of your language. That passage has nothing
to do here."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zwingle</span>, hastily.&mdash;"Pardon me, doctor, that passage breaks
your neck."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"Do not boast so much! You are in Hesse, and
not in Switzerland. In this country we do not break people's
necks."</p>

<p>Then turning towards his friends, Luther complained bitterly
of Zwingle; as if the latter had really wished to break
his neck. "He makes use of soldier-like and blood-stained
words," said he.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Luther forgot that he had employed a similar
expression in speaking of Carlstadt.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zwingle</span> resumed: "In Switzerland also there is strict
justice, and we break no man's neck without trial. That expression
signifies merely that your cause is lost and hopeless."</p>

<p>Great agitation prevailed in the Knights' Hall. The
roughness of the Swiss and the obstinacy of the Saxon had
come into collision. The Landgrave, fearing to behold the
failure of his project of conciliation, nodded assent to Zwingle's
explanation. "Doctor," said he to Luther, "you should not
be offended at such common expressions." It was in vain:
the agitated sea could not again be calmed. The prince
therefore arose, and they all repaired to the banqueting hall.
After dinner they resumed their tasks.</p>

<p>"I believe," said Luther, "that Christ's body is in heaven,
but I also believe that it is in the sacrament. It concerns me
little whether that be against nature, provided that it is not
against faith.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> Christ is substantially in the sacrament, such
as he was born of the Virgin."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">METAPHOR.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">&OElig;colampadius</span>, quoting a passage from St. Paul: "We
know not Jesus Christ after the flesh."<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"After the flesh means, in this passage, after
our carnal affections."<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">&OElig;colampadius.</span>&mdash;"You will not allow that there is a metaphor
in these words, <i>This is my body</i>, and yet you admit a synecdoche."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"Metaphor permits the existence of a sign only;
but it is not so with synecdoche. If a man says he wishes to
drink a bottle, we understand that he means the beer in the
bottle. Christ's body is in the bread, as a sword in the scabbard,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
or as the Holy Ghost in the dove."</p>

<p>The discussion was proceeding in this manner, when Osiander,
pastor of Nuremberg, Stephen Agricola, pastor of Augsburg,
and Brenz, pastor of Halle in Swabia, author of the
famous Syngramma, entered the hall. These also had been
invited by the Landgrave. But Brenz, to whom Luther had
written that he should take care not to appear, had no doubt
by his indecision retarded his own departure as well as that
of his friends. Places were assigned them near Luther and
Melancthon. "Listen, and speak if necessary," they were
told. They took but little advantage of this permission. "All
of us, except Luther," said Melancthon, "were silent personages."<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>The struggle continued.</p>

<p>When Zwingle saw that exegesis was not sufficient for Luther,
he added dogmatical theology to it, and, subsidiarily,
natural philosophy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRIST'S HUMANITY FINITE.</div>

<p>"I oppose you," said he, "with this article of our faith: <i>Ascendit
in cælum</i>&mdash;he ascended into heaven. If Christ is in
heaven as regards his body, how can he be in the bread?
The Word of God teaches us that he was like his brethren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
in all things (Heb. ii. 17). He therefore cannot be in several
places at once."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"Were I desirous of reasoning thus, I would undertake
to prove that Jesus Christ had a wife; that he had
black eyes,<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> and lived in our good country of Germany.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> I
care little about mathematics."</p>

<p>"There is no question of mathematics here," said Zwingle,
"but of St. Paul, who writes to the Philippians, &#956;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#7969;&#957; &#948;&#959;&#8017;&#955;&#959;&#965; &#955;&#945;&#946;&#8033;&#957;."<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther</span>, interrupting him.&mdash;"Read it to us in Latin or in
German, not in Greek."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zwingle</span> (in Latin).&mdash;"Pardon me: for twelve years past
I have made use of the Greek Testament only." Then continuing
to read the passage, he concluded from it that Christ's
humanity is of a finite nature like our own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther</span>, pointing to the words written before him.&mdash;"Most
dear sirs, since my Lord Jesus Christ says, <i>Hoc est corpus
meum</i>, I believe that his body is really there."</p>

<p>Here the scene grew animated. Zwingle started from his
chair, sprung towards Luther, and striking the table before
him, said to him:<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>"You maintain then, doctor, that Christ's body is locally in
the Eucharist; for you say Christ's body is really <i>there</i>&mdash;<i>there</i>&mdash;<i>there</i>,"
repeated Zwingle. "<i>There</i> is an adverb of place.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
Christ's body is then of such a nature as to exist in a place.
If it is in a place, it is in heaven, whence it follows that it is
not in the bread."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"I repeat that I have nothing to do with mathematical
proofs. As soon as the words of consecration are pronounced
over the bread, the body is there, however wicked
be the priest who pronounces them."</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRESENCE OF CHRIST'S BODY.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span><span class="smcap">Zwingle.</span>&mdash;"You are thus re-establishing Popery.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"This is not done through the priest's merits,
but because of Christ's ordinance. I will not, when Christ's
body is in question, hear speak of a particular place. I absolutely
will not."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zwingle.</span>&mdash;"Must every thing, then, exist precisely as you
will it?"</p>

<p>The Landgrave perceived that the discussion was growing
hot; and as the repast was waiting, he broke off the contest.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>The next day was Sunday, the 3d October. The conference
was continued, perhaps because of an epidemic (the
Sweating Sickness) that had just broken out at Marburg, and
did not allow of the conference being prolonged. Luther, returning
to the discussion of the previous evening, said:</p>

<p>"Christ's body is in the sacrament, but it is not there as in
a place."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zwingle.</span>&mdash;"Then it is not there at all."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"Sophists say that a body may very well be in
several places at once. The universe is a body, and yet we
cannot assert that it is in a particular place."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zwingle.</span>&mdash;"Ah! you speak of sophists, doctor: really
you are, after all, obliged to return to the onions and flesh-pots
of Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> As for what you say, that the universe is in
no particular place, I beg all intelligent men to weigh this
proof." Then Zwingle, who, whatever Luther said, had
more than one arrow in his quiver, after having established
his proposition by exegesis and philosophy, resolved on confirming
it by the testimony of the Fathers of the Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TESTIMONY OF AUGUSTIN.</div>

<p>"Listen," said he, "to what Fulgentius, bishop of Ruspa,
in Numidia, said, in the fifth century, to Trasamond, king of
the Vandals: 'The Son of God took the attributes of true humanity,
and did not lose those of true Divinity. Born in time,
according to his mother, he lives in eternity according to the
Divinity that he holds from the Father: coming from man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
he is man, and consequently in a place; proceeding from the
Father, he is God, and consequently present in every place.
According to his human nature, he was absent from heaven
while he was upon earth, and he quitted the earth when he
ascended into heaven; but, according to his Divine nature,
he remained in heaven when he came down thence, and he
did not abandon the earth when he returned thither.'"<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>But Luther still replied: "It is written, <i>This is my body</i>."
Zwingle, becoming impatient, said, "All that is idle wrangling.
An obstinate disputant might also maintain this expression
of our Saviour to his mother, <i>Behold thy son</i>, pointing to
St. John. Vain would be all explanation; he would not cease
to cry, No, no! He said, <i>Ecce filius tuus</i>, Behold thy son, behold
thy son! Listen to a new testimony; it is from the
great Augustin: 'Let us not think,' says he, 'that Christ, according
to his human form, is present in every place; let us
beware, in our endeavour to establish his Divinity, of taking
away his truth from his body. Christ is now every where
present like God; and yet, in consequence of his real body,
he is in a definite part of heaven.'"<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>"St. Augustin," replied Luther, "is not here speaking
of the Eucharist. Christ's body is not in the Eucharist as
in a place."</p>

<p>&OElig;colampadius saw that he might take advantage of this
assertion of Luther's. "The body of Christ," said he, "is not
locally in the Eucharist, therefore no real body is there; for
every one knows that the essence of a body is its existence in
a place."</p>

<p>Here finished the morning's discussion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S VIOLENCE.</div>

<p>&OElig;colampadius, upon reflection, felt convinced that Luther's
assertion might be looked upon as an approximation. "I remember,"
said he after dinner, "that the doctor conceded this
morning that Christ's body was not in the sacrament as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
a place. Let us therefore inquire amicably what is the nature
of Christ's bodily presence."</p>

<p>"You will not make me take a step further," exclaimed
Luther, who saw where they wished to drag him; "you
have Fulgentius and Augustin on your side, but all the other
Fathers are on ours."</p>

<p>&OElig;colampadius, who seemed to the Wittembergers to be
vexatiously precise,<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> then said, "Name these doctors. We
will take upon ourselves to prove that they are of our opinion."</p>

<p>"We will not name them to you,"<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> said Luther. "It
was in his youth," added he, "that Augustin wrote what
you have quoted; and, besides, he is an obscure author."
Then, retreating to the ground which he had resolved never
to quit, he was no longer content to point his finger at the
inscription, <i>Hoc est corpus meum</i>, but seized the velvet cover
on which the words were written, pulled it off the table, held
it up in front of Zwingle and &OElig;colampadius, and placing it
before their eyes,<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> "See!" said he, "see! This is our text;
you have not yet driven us from it, as you had boasted, and
we care for no other proofs."</p>

<p>"If this be the case," said &OElig;colampadius, "we had better
leave off the discussion. But I will first declare, that, if we
quote the Fathers, it is only to free our doctrine from the
reproach of novelty, and not to support our cause by their authority."
No better definition can be given of the legitimate
use of the Doctors of the Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">END OF THE CONFERENCE.</div>

<p>There was no reason, in fact, for prolonging the conference.
"As Luther was of an intractable and imperious disposition,"
says even his great apologist Seckendorf, "he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
not cease from calling upon the Swiss to submit simply to his
opinion."<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>The Chancellor, alarmed at this termination of the colloquy,
exhorted the theologians to come to an understanding.
"I know but one means for that," said Luther; "and this it
is: Let our adversaries believe as we do." "We cannot," replied
the Swiss. "Well then," replied Luther, "I abandon
you to God's judgment, and pray that he will enlighten you."
"We will do the same," added &OElig;colampadius.</p>

<p>While these words were passing, Zwingle was silent,
motionless, and deeply moved; and the liveliness of his affections,
of which he had given more than one proof during
the conference, was then manifested in a very different manner.
He burst into tears in the presence of all.</p>

<p>The conference was ended. It had been in reality more
tranquil than the documents seem to show, or perhaps the
chroniclers appreciated such matters differently from ourselves.
"With the exception of a few sallies, all had passed
off quietly, in a courteous manner, and with very great gentleness,"
says an eye-witness.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> "During the colloquy no
other words than these were heard: 'Sir, and very dear
friend, your charity,' or other similar expressions. Not a
word of schism or of heresy. It might have been said that
Luther and Zwingle were brothers, and not adversaries."<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
This is the testimony of Brenz. But these flowers concealed
an abyss, and Jonas, also an eye-witness, styles the conference
"a very sharp contest."<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LANDGRAVE MEDIATES.</div>

<p>The contagion that had suddenly broken out in Marburg
was creating frightful ravages, and filled everybody with
alarm.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Each one was anxious to leave the city. "Sirs,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
remarked the Landgrave, "you cannot separate thus." And
desirous of giving the doctors an opportunity of meeting one
another with minds unoccupied by theological debates, he invited
them all to his table. This was Sunday night.</p>

<p>Philip of Hesse had all along shown the most constant attention,
and each one imagined him to be on his side. "I
would rather place my trust in the simple words of Christ,
than in the subtle thoughts of man," was a remark he made,
according to Jonas;<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> but Zwingle affirmed that this prince
thought now as he did, although with regard to certain persons
he dissembled his opinions. Luther, sensible of the
weakness of his defence as to the declarations of the Fathers,
transmitted a note to Philip, in which several passages were
pointed out from Hilary, Chrysostom, Cyprian, Irenæus, and
Ambrose, which he thought were in his favour.</p>

<p>The time of departure drew near, and nothing had been
done. The Landgrave toiled earnestly at the union, as Luther
wrote to his wife.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> He invited the theologians one after
another into his closet;<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> he pressed, entreated, warned, exhorted,
and conjured them. "Think," said he, "of the salvation
of the christian republic, and remove all discord from
its bosom."<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Never had general at the head of an army
taken such pains to win a battle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE'S EMOTION.</div>

<p>A final general meeting took place and undoubtedly the
Church has seldom witnessed one of greater solemnity. Luther
and Zwingle, Saxony and Switzerland, met for the last
time. The Sweating Sickness was carrying off men around
them by thousands;<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Charles the Fifth and the Pope were
uniting in Italy; Ferdinand and the Roman-catholic princes
were preparing to tear in pieces the Protest of Spire; the
thunder-cloud became more threatening every day; union<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
alone seemed capable of saving the Protestants, and the hour
of departure was about to strike&mdash;an hour that would separate
them perhaps for ever.</p>

<p>"Let us confess our union in all things in which we agree,"
said Zwingle; "and as for the rest, let us remember that we
are brothers. There will never be peace between the
Churches if, while we maintain the grand doctrine of salvation
by faith, we cannot differ on secondary points."<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Such
is, in fact, the true principle of christian union. The sixteenth
century was still too deeply sunk in scholasticism to understand
this: let us hope that the nineteenth century will comprehend
it better.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" exclaimed the Landgrave; "you agree! Give
then a testimony of your unity, and recognise one another as
brothers."&mdash;"There is no one upon earth with whom I more
desire to be united, than with you," said Zwingle, approaching
the Wittemberg doctors.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> &OElig;colampadius, Bucer, and
Hedio said the same.</p>

<p>"Acknowledge them! acknowledge them as brothers!"
continued the Landgrave.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Their hearts were moved; they
were on the eve of unity: Zwingle, bursting into tears, in the
presence of the Prince, the courtiers, and divines (it is Luther
himself who records this),<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> approaches Luther, and holds
out his hand. The two families of the Reformation were
about to be united: long quarrels were about to be stifled in
their cradle; but Luther rejects the hand that is offered him:
"You have a different spirit from ours," said he. These
words communicate to the Swiss, as it were, an electrical
shock. Their hearts sunk each time Luther repeated them,
and he did so frequently. It is he himself who is our informant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">SECTARIAN SPIRIT OF THE GERMAN.</div>

<p>A brief consultation took place among the Wittemberg doctors.
Luther, Melancthon, Agricola, Brenz, Jonas, and Osiander,
conferred together. Convinced that their peculiar doctrine
on the Eucharist was essential to salvation, they considered
all those who rejected it as without the pale of the faith.
"What folly!"<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> said Melancthon, who afterwards almost coincided
with Zwingle's sentiments: "they condemn us, and yet
they desire we should consider them as our brothers!" "What
versatility!" added Brenz: "they accused us but lately of
worshipping a bread-god, and they now ask for communion
with us!"<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> Then, turning towards Zwingle and his friends,
the Wittembergers said: "You do not belong to the communion
of the Christian Church: we cannot acknowledge
you as brethren!"<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>The Swiss were far from partaking of this sectarian spirit.
"We think," said Bucer, "that your doctrine strikes at the
glory of Jesus Christ, who now reigns at the right hand of
the Father. But seeing that in all things you acknowledge
your dependence on the Lord, we look at your conscience,
which compels you to receive the doctrine you profess, and
we do not doubt that you belong to Christ."</p>

<p>"And we," said Luther&mdash;"we declare to you once more
that our conscience opposes our receiving you as brethren."&mdash;"If
such is the case," replied Bucer, "it would be folly to
ask it."</p>

<p>"I am exceedingly astonished that you wish to consider me
as your brother," pursued Luther. "It shows clearly that
you do not attach much importance to your own doctrine."</p>

<div class="sidenote">BROTHERHOOD REJECTED.</div>

<p>"Take your choice," said Bucer, proposing a dilemma to
the Reformer: "either you should not acknowledge as brethren
those who differ from you in any point&mdash;and if so, you
will not find a single brother in your own ranks<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>&mdash;or else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
you will receive some of those who differ from you, and then
you ought to receive us."</p>

<p>The Swiss had exhausted their solicitations. "We are
conscious," said they, "of having acted as if in the presence
of God. Posterity will be our witness."<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> They were on
the point of retiring: Luther remained like a rock, to the
Landgrave's great indignation.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> The Hessian divines,
Kraft, Lambert, Snepf, Lonicer, and Melander, united their
exertions to those of the Prince.</p>

<p>Luther was staggered, and conferred anew with his colleagues.
"Let us beware," said he to his friends, "of wiping
our noses too roughly, lest blood should come."<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>Then turning to Zwingle and &OElig;colampadius, they said:
"We acknowledge you as friends; we do not consider you
as brothers and members of Christ's Church.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> But we do
not exclude you from that universal charity which we owe
even to our enemies."<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>The hearts of Zwingle, &OElig;colampadius, and Bucer, were
ready to burst,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> for this concession was almost a new insult.
Nevertheless they resolved to accept what was offered them.
"Let us carefully avoid all harsh and violent words and
writings," said they; "and let each one defend himself without
railing."<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>Luther then advanced towards the Swiss, and said: "We
consent, and I offer you the hand of peace and charity."
The Swiss rushed in great emotion towards the Wittembergers,
and all shook hands.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> Luther himself was softened:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
christian charity resumed her rights in his heart. "Assuredly,"
said he, "a great portion of the scandal is taken away
by the suppression of our fierce debates; we could not have
hoped for so much. May Christ's hand remove the last obstacle
that separates us.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> There is now a friendly concord between
us, and if we persevere in prayer, brotherhood will
come."</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S REPORT OF THE CONFERENCE.</div>

<p>It was desirable to confirm this important result by a report.
"We must let the christian world know," said the
Landgrave, "that, except the manner of the presence of the
body and blood in the Eucharist, you are agreed in all the
articles of faith."<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> This was resolved on; but who should
be charged with drawing up the paper? All eyes were
turned upon Luther. The Swiss themselves appealed to his
impartiality.</p>

<p>Luther retired to his closet, lost in thought, uneasy, and
finding the task very difficult. "On the one hand," said he,
"I should like to spare their weakness;<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> but, on the other, I
would not in the least degree strike at the holy doctrine of
Christ." He did not know how to set about it, and his anguish
increased. He got free at last. "I will draw up the
articles," said he, "in the most accurate manner. Do I not
know that whatever I write, they will never sign them?"<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>
Erelong fifteen articles were committed to paper, and Luther,
holding them in his hand, repaired to the theologians of the
two parties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">UNITY OF DOCTRINE.</div>

<p>These articles are of importance. The two doctrines that
were evolved in Switzerland and in Saxony, independently
of each other, were brought together and compared. If they
were of man, there would be found in them a servile uniformity,
or a remarkable opposition. This was not the case.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
A great unity was found between the German and the Swiss
Reformations, for they both proceeded from the same Divine
teaching; and a diversity on secondary points, for it was by
man's instrumentality that God had effected them.</p>

<p>Luther took his paper, and reading the first article, said:</p>

<p>"First, we believe that there is one sole, true, and natural
God, Creator of heaven and earth and of all creatures; and
that this same God, one in essence and in nature, is threefold
in person, that is to say, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, as was
declared in the Nicene Council, and as all the Christian
Church professes."</p>

<p>To this the Swiss gave their assent.</p>

<p>They were agreed also on the divinity and humanity of
Jesus Christ; on his death and resurrection, on original sin,
justification by faith, the operation of the Holy Ghost and of
the Word of God, baptism, good works, confession, civil order,
and tradition.</p>

<p>Thus far all were united. The Wittembergers could not
recover from their astonishment.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> The two parties had rejected,
on the one hand, the errors of the Papists, who make religion
little more than an outward form; and, on the other,
those of the Enthusiasts, who speak exclusively of internal
feelings; and they were found drawn up under the same
banners between these two camps. But the moment was
come that would separate them. Luther had kept till the
last the article on the Eucharist.</p>

<p>The Reformer resumed:</p>

<p>"We all believe with regard to the Lord's Supper, that
it ought to be celebrated in both kinds, according to the
primitive institution; that the Mass is not a work by which a
Christian obtains pardon for another man, whether dead or
alive; that the sacrament of the altar is the sacrament of the
very body and very blood of Jesus Christ; and that the spiritual
manducation of this body and blood is specially necessary
to every true Christian."<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">UNITY AMONG DIVERSITY.</div>

<p>It was now the turn of the Swiss to be astonished. Luther
continued:</p>

<p>"In like manner, as to the use of the sacrament, we are
agreed that, like the Word, it was ordained of Almighty
God, in order that weak consciences might be excited by
the Holy Ghost to faith and charity."</p>

<p>The joy of the Swiss was redoubled. Luther continued:
"And although at present we are not agreed on the question
whether the real body and blood of Christ are corporeally
present in the bread and wine, yet both the interested
parties shall cherish more and more a truly christian charity
for one another, so far as conscience permits; and we will all
earnestly implore the Lord to condescend by his Spirit to confirm
us in the sound doctrine."<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>The Swiss obtained what they had asked: unity in diversity.
It was immediately resolved to hold a solemn meeting
for the signature of the articles.</p>

<p>They were read over again. &OElig;colampadius, Zwingle,
Bucer, and Hedio, signed them first on one copy; while
Luther, Melancthon, Jonas, Osiander, Brentz, and Agricola,
wrote their names on the other; both parties then signed the
copy of their adversaries, and this important document was
sent to the press.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">REMARKS.</div>

<p>Thus the Reformation had made a sensible step at Marburg.
The opinion of Zwingle on the spiritual presence,
and of Luther on the bodily presence, are both found in
christian antiquity; but both the extreme doctrines have been
always rejected: that of the Rationalists, on the one hand,
who behold in the Eucharist nothing but a simple commemoration;
and of the Papists, on the other, who adore in it a
transubstantiation. These are both errors; while the doctrines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of Luther and Zwingle, and the medium taken by
Calvin, already maintained by some of the Fathers, were considered
in ancient times as different views of the same truth.
If Luther had yielded, it might have been feared that the
Church would fall into the extreme of Rationalism; if
Zwingle, that it would rush into the extreme of Popery. It
is a salutary thing for the Church that these different views
should be entertained; but it is a pernicious thing for individuals
to attach themselves to one of them, in such a manner
as to anathematize the others. "There is only this little
stumbling-block," wrote Melancthon, "that embarrasses the
Church of our Lord."<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> All,&mdash;Romanists and Evangelicals,
Saxons and Swiss, admitted the presence, and even the real
presence of Christ; but here was the essential point of separation:
Is this presence effected by the faith of the communicant,
or by the <i>opus operatum</i> of the priest? The germs of
Popery, Sacerdotalism, Puseyism, are inevitably contained in
this latter thesis. If it is maintained that a wicked priest
(as has been said) operates this real presence of Christ by
three words, we enter the Church of the Pope. Luther appeared
sometimes to admit this doctrine, but he has often spoken
in a more spiritual manner; and taking this great man
in his best moments, we behold no more than an essential
unity and a secondary diversity in the two parties of the Reformation.
Undoubtedly the Lord has left his Church outward
seals of his grace; but he has not attached salvation
to these signs. The essential point is the connexion of the
faithful with the Word, with the Holy Ghost, with the Head
of the Church. This is the great truth which the Reform
proclaims, and which Lutheranism itself recognises. After
the Marburg conference, the controversy became more moderate.</p>

<p>There was another advantage. The evangelical divines
at Marburg marked with one accord their separation from
the Papacy. Zwingle was not without fear (unfounded, no
doubt) with regard to Luther: these fears were dispersed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
"Now that we are agreed," said he, "the Papists will no
longer hope that Luther will ever be one of them."<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> The
Marburg articles are the first bulwark erected in common
by the Reformers against Rome.</p>

<p>It was not, then, in vain that, after the protest of Spire,
Philip of Hesse endeavoured, at Marburg, to bring together
the friends of the Gospel. But, if the religious object was
partially attained, the political object almost entirely failed.
They could not arrive at a confederation of Switzerland and
Germany. Nevertheless, Philip of Hesse and Zwingle, with
a view to this, had numerous secret conversations, which
made the Saxons uneasy, as they were not less opposed to
Zwingle's politics than to his theology. "When you have
reformed the peasant's cap," said Jonas to him, "you will also
claim to reform the sable hat of princes."</p>

<p>The Landgrave, having collected all the doctors at his table
on the last day, they shook hands in a friendly manner,<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
and each one thought of leaving the town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S DEJECTION.</div>

<p>On Tuesday the 5th October, the Landgrave quitted Marburg
early, and in the afternoon of the same day Luther departed,
accompanied by his colleagues; but he did not go
forth as a conqueror. A spirit of dejection and alarm had
taken possession of his mind.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> He writhed in the dust, like
a worm, according to his own expression. He fancied he
should never see his wife and children again, and cried out
that he, "the consoler of so many tortured souls, was now
without any consolation!"<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">STATE OF POLITICAL AFFAIRS.</div>

<p>This state might partly arise from Luther's want of brotherly
feeling; but it had other causes also. Soliman had
come to fulfil a promise made to King Ferdinand. The latter
having demanded, in 1528, the surrender of Belgrade, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Sultan had haughtily replied, that he would bring the keys
himself to Vienna. In fact, the Grand Turk, crossing the
frontiers of Germany, had invaded countries "on which the
hoofs of the Mussulman war-horses had never trod," and
eight days before the conference at Marburg, he had covered
with his innumerable tents the plain and the fertile hills in
the midst of which rise the walls of Vienna. The struggle
had begun under ground, the two parties having dug deep
galleries beneath the ramparts. Three different times the
Turkish mines were sprung; the walls were thrown down;<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>
"the balls flew through the air like a flight of small birds,"
says a Turkish historian; "and there was a horrible banquet,
at which the genii of death joyously drained their glasses."<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>Luther did not keep in the background. He had already
written against the Turks, and now he published a <i>Battle Sermon</i>.
"Mahomet," said he, "exalts Christ as being without
sin; but he denies that he was the true God; therefore he is
his enemy. Alas! to this hour the world is such that it seems
everywhere to rain disciples of Mahomet. Two men ought to
oppose the Turks: the first is Christian, that is to say, Prayer;
the second is Charles, that is to say, The sword." And in another
place, "I know my dear Germans well, fat and well-fed
swine; as soon as the danger is removed, they think only of
eating and sleeping. Wretched man! if thou dost not take up
arms the Turk will come; he will carry thee away into his
Turkey; he will there sell thee like a dog; and thou shalt
serve him night and day, under the rod and the cudgel, for
a glass of water and a morsel of bread. Think on this; be
converted, and implore the Lord not to give thee the Turk
for thy schoolmaster."<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">VARIETY OF CHARACTER.</div>

<p>The two arms pointed out by Luther were, in reality, vigorously
employed; and Soliman, perceiving at last that he
was not the "soul of the universe," as his poets had styled him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
but that there was a strength in the world superior to his
own, raised the siege of Vienna on the 16th October; and
"the shadow of God over the two worlds," as he called himself,
"disappeared and vanished in the Bosphorus."</p>

<p>But Luther imagined that, when retiring from before the
walls of Vienna, "the Turk, or at least his god, who is the
devil," had rushed upon him; and that it was this enemy
of Christ and of Christ's servants that he was destined to
combat and vanquish in his frightful agony.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> There is an
immediate reaction of the violated law upon him who violates
it. Now Luther had transgressed the royal law, which
is charity, and he suffered the penalty. At last he re-entered
Wittemberg, and flung himself into the arms of his
friends, "tormented by the angel of death."<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>Without, however, overlooking the essential qualities of a
Reformer that Luther manifested at Marburg, there are in
God's work, as in a drama, different parts. What various
characters we see among the Apostles and among the Reformers!
It has been said that the same characters and the
same parts were assigned to St. Peter and to Luther, at the
time of the Formation and of the Reformation of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
They were both in fact men of the initiative, who start forward
quite alone, but around whom an army soon collects at
the sight of the standard which they wave.</p>

<p>But there was perhaps in the Reformer a characteristic that
was not found to the same degree in the Apostle; this is firmness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXASPERATION OF THE PAPISTS.</div>

<p>As for Zwingle, he quitted Marburg in alarm at Luther's
intolerance. "Lutheranism," wrote he to the Landgrave,
"will lie as heavy upon us as Popery."<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> He reached Zurich
on the 19th October. "The truth," said he to his friends, "has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
prevailed so manifestly, that if ever any one has been defeated
before all the world, it is Luther, although he constantly exclaimed
that he was invincible."<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> On his side, Luther spoke
in a similar strain. "It is through fear of their fellow-citizens,"
added he, "that the Swiss, although vanquished, are
unwilling to retract."<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>If it should be asked on which side the victory really was,
perhaps we ought to say that Luther assumed the air of a
conqueror, but Zwingle was so in reality. The conference
propagated through all Germany the doctrine of the Swiss,
which had been little known there till that time, and it was
adopted by an immense number of persons. Among these
were Laffards, first rector of St. Martin's School at Brunswick,
Dionysius Melander, Justus Lening, Hartmann, Ibach, and
many more. The Landgrave himself, a short time before his
death, declared that this conference had induced him to renounce
the oral manducation of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>Still the dominant principle at this celebrated epoch was
unity. The adversaries are the best judges. The Roman-catholics
were exasperated that the Lutherans and Zwinglians
had agreed on all the essential points of faith. "They
have a fellow-feeling against the Catholic Church," said they,
"as Herod and Pilate against Jesus Christ." The enthusiastic
sects said the same,<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> and the extreme hierarchial as
well as the extreme radical party deprecated equally the
unity of Marburg.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THREATENING PROSPECTS.</div>

<p>Erelong a greater agitation eclipsed all these rumours,
and events which threatened the whole evangelical body,
proclaimed its great and intimate union with new force.
The Emperor, it was everywhere said, exasperated by the
Protest of Spire, has landed at Genoa with the pomp of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
conqueror. After having sworn at Barcelona to reduce the
heretics under the power of the Pope, he is going to visit this
pontiff, humbly to bend the knee before him; and he will
rise up only to cross the Alps and accomplish his terrible designs.
"The Emperor Charles," said Luther, a few days after
the landing of this prince, "has determined to show himself
more cruel against us than the Turk himself, and he has
already uttered the most horrible threats. Behold the hour
of Christ's agony and weakness. Let us pray for all those
who will soon have to endure captivity and death."<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>Such was the news that then agitated all Germany. The
grand question was, whether the Protest of Spire could be
maintained against the power of the Emperor and of the
Pope. This was seen in the year 1530.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<h2>BOOK XIV.</h2>

<h3>THE AUGSBURG CONFESSION. 1530.</h3>


<p>I. The Reformation was accomplished in the name of a
spiritual principle. It had proclaimed for its teacher the
Word of God; for salvation, Faith; for king, Jesus Christ;
for arms, the Holy Ghost; and had by these very means rejected
all worldly elements. Rome had been established by
<i>the law of a carnal commandment</i>; the Reformation, by <i>the
power of an endless life</i>.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>If there is any doctrine that distinguishes Christianity from
every other religion, it is its spirituality. A heavenly life
brought down to man&mdash;such is its work; thus the opposition
of the spirit of the Gospel to the spirit of the world was the
great fact which signalized the entrance of Christianity
among the nations. But what its Founder had separated,
had soon come together again; the Church had fallen into
the arms of the world; and this criminal Union had reduced
it to the deplorable condition in which it was found at the era
of the Reformation.</p>

<p>Thus one of the greatest tasks of the sixteenth century
was to restore the spiritual element to its rights. The Gospel
of the Reformers had nothing to do with the world and with
politics. While the Roman hierarchy had become a matter
of diplomacy and a court intrigue, the Reformation was destined
to exercise no other influence over princes and people
than that which proceeds from the Gospel of peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TWO STRIKING LESSONS.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>If the Reformation, having attained a certain point, became
untrue to its nature, began to parley and temporize with the
world, and ceased thus to follow up the spiritual principle
that it had so loudly proclaimed, it was faithless to God and
to itself.</p>

<p>Henceforward its decline was at hand.</p>

<p>It is impossible for a society to prosper if it be unfaithful to
the principles it lays down. Having abandoned what constituted
its life, it can find naught but death.</p>

<p>It was God's will that this great truth should be inscribed
on the very threshold of the temple He was then raising in
the world; and a striking contrast was to make this truth
stand gloriously forth.</p>

<p>One portion of the Reform was to seek the alliance of the
world, and in this alliance find a destruction full of desolation.</p>

<p>Another portion, looking up to God, was haughtily to reject
the arm of the flesh, and by this very act of faith secure
a noble victory.</p>

<p>If three centuries have gone astray, it is because they were
unable to comprehend so holy and solemn a lesson.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It was in the beginning of September 1529 that Charles V.,
the victor by battles or by treaties over the Pope and the King
of France, had landed at Genoa. The shouts of the Spaniards
had saluted him as he quitted the Iberian peninsula; but
the dejected eyes, the bended heads, the silent lips of the Italians
given over to his hands, alone welcomed him to the foot
of the Apennines. Everything led to the belief that Charles
would indemnify himself on them for the apparent generosity
with which he had treated the Pope.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARLES THE FIFTH.</div>

<p>They were deceived. Instead of those barbarous chiefs of
the Goths and Huns, or of those proud and fierce emperors,
who more than once had crossed the Alps and rushed upon
Italy, sword in hand and with cries of vengeance, the Italians
saw among them a young and graceful prince, with pale
features, a delicate frame, and weak voice, of winning manners,
having more the air of a courtier than a warrior, scrupulously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
performing all the duties of the Romish religion, and
leading in his train no terrible cohorts of German barbarians,
but a brilliant retinue of Spanish grandees, who complacently
paraded the pride of their race and the splendour of their
nation. This prince, the victor of Europe, spoke only of
peace and amnesty; and even the Duke of Ferrara, who of
all the Italian princes had most cause of fear, having at Modena
placed the keys of the city in his hands, heard from his
friendly lips the most unexpected encouragements.</p>

<p>Whence did this strange conduct proceed? Charles, had
shown plainly enough, at the time of the captivity of Francis
I., that generosity towards his enemies was not his dominant
virtue. It was not long before this mystery was explained.</p>

<p>Almost at the same time with Charles there arrived in Italy,
by way of Lyons and Genoa, three German burgesses, whose
whole equipage consisted of six horses.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> These were John
Ehinger, burgomaster of Memmingen, who carried his head
high, scattered money around him, and did not pride himself
on great sobriety; Michael Caden, syndic of Nuremberg,
a worthy, pious, and brave man, but detested by the Count of
Nassau, the most influential of Charles's ministers; and,
lastly, Alexis Frauentraut, secretary to the Margrave of Brandenburg,
who, having married a nun, was in very bad esteem
among the Roman-catholics. Such were the three men whom
the Protestant princes, assembled at Nuremberg, commissioned
to bear to the Emperor the famous Protest of Spire. They
had purposely chosen these deputies from a middle station, under
the impression that they would incur less danger.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> To
carry such a message to Charles V. was, to say the truth, a
mission which few persons cared to execute. Accordingly a
pension had been secured to the widows of these envoys in
case of misfortune.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOLDNESS OF THE ENVOYS.</div>

<p>Charles was on his way from Genoa to Bologna, and staying
at Piacenza, when the three Protestant deputies overtook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
him. These plain Germans presented a singular contrast in
the midst of that Spanish pomp and Romish fervour by which
the young prince was surrounded. Cardinal Gattinara, the
Emperor's chancellor, who sincerely desired a reform of the
Church, procured them an audience of Charles V. for the 22d
of September; but they were recommended to be sparing in
their words, for there was nothing the Emperor so much
disliked as a Protestant sermon.</p>

<p>The deputies were not checked by these insinuations
and after having handed the protest to Charles, Frauentraut
began to speak: "It is to the Supreme Judge that each one
of us must render an account," said he, "and not to creatures
who turn at every wind. It is better to fall into the most cruel
necessity, than to incur the anger of God. Our nation will
obey no decrees that are based on any other foundation than
the Holy Scriptures."<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>Such was the proud tone held by these German citizens to
the Emperor of the West. Charles said not a word&mdash;it
would have been paying them too much honour; but he
charged one of his secretaries to announce an answer at some
future time.</p>

<p>There was no hurry to send back these petty ambassadors.
In vain did they renew their solicitations daily. Gattinara
treated them with kindness, but Nassau sent them away with
bitter words. A workman, the armourer to the court, having
to visit Augsburg to purchase arms, begged the Count of Nassau
to despatch the Protestant deputies. "You may tell
them," replied the minister of Charles V., "that we will
terminate their business in order that you may have travelling
companions." But the armourer having found other company,
they were compelled to wait.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LANDGRAVE'S PRESENT.</div>

<p>These envoys endeavoured at least to make a good use of
their time. "Take this book," said the Landgrave to Caden
at the very moment of departure, giving him a French work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
bound in velvet, and richly ornamented, "and deliver it to the
Emperor."<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> It was a summary of the Christian Faith which
the Landgrave had received from Francis Lambert, and
which had probably been written by that doctor. Caden
sought an opportunity of presenting this treatise; and did so
one day, therefore, as Charles was going publickly to Mass.
The Emperor took the book, and passed it immediately to
a Spanish bishop. The Spaniard began to read it,<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> and lighted
upon that passage of Scripture in which Christ enjoins
his apostles <i>not to exercise lordship</i>.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> The author took advantage
of it to maintain that the minister, charged with spiritual
matters, should not interfere with those which are temporal.
The Papist prelate bit his lips, and Charles, who perceived
it, having asked, "Well, what is the matter?" the bishop in
confusion had recourse to a falsehood.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> "This treatise," replied
he, "takes the sword from the christian magistrate, and
grants it only to nations that are strangers to the faith." Immediately
there was a great uproar: the Spaniards above all
were beside themselves.</p>

<p>"The wretches that have endeavoured to mislead so young
a prince," said they, "deserve to be hung on the first tree by
the wayside!" Charles swore, in fact, that the bearer should
suffer the penalty of his audacity.</p>

<p>At length, on the 12th October, Alexander Schweiss, imperial
secretary, transmitted the Emperor's reply to the deputies.
It said that the minority ought to submit to the decrees
passed in diet, and that if the Duke of Saxony and his allies
refused, means would not be wanting to compel them.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ENVOYS UNDER ARREST.</div>

<p>Ehinger and Caden thereupon read aloud the appeal to
the Emperor drawn up at Spire, whilst Frauentraut, who had
renounced his quality of deputy and assumed that of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
notary,<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> took notes of what was passing. When the reading
was finished, the deputies advanced towards Schweiss and
presented the appeal. The imperial secretary rejected the
document with amazement; the deputies insisted; Schweiss
continued firm. They then laid the appeal on the table.
Schweiss was staggered; he took the paper, and carried it
to the Emperor.</p>

<p>After dinner, just as one of the deputies (Caden) had gone
out, a tumult in the hotel announced some catastrophe. It
was the imperial secretary who returned duly accompanied.
"The Emperor is exceedingly irritated against you on account
of this appeal," said he to the Protestants; "and he
forbids you, under pain of confiscation and death, to leave
your hotel, to write to Germany, or to send any message
whatsoever."<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> Thus Charles put ambassadors under arrest,
as he would the officers of his guard, desirous in this manner
of publishing his contempt, and of frightening the princes.</p>

<p>Caden's servant slipped in alarm out of the hotel, and ran
to his master. The latter, still considering himself free, wrote
a hasty account of the whole business to the senate of Nuremberg,
sent off his letters by express, and returned to share
in the arrest of his colleagues.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MEETING OF CHARLES AND CLEMENT.</div>

<p>On the 23d of October, the Emperor left Piacenza, carrying
the three Germans with him. But on the 30th he released
Ehinger and Frauentraut, who, mounting their horses
in the middle of the night, rushed at full speed along a
route thronged with soldiers and robbers. "As for you," said
Granvelle to Caden, "you will stay under pain of death.
The Emperor expects that the book you presented to him
will be given up to the Pope."<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Perhaps Charles thought it
pleasant to show the Roman Pontiff this prohibition issued
against the ministers of God to mingle in the government of
nations. But Caden, profiting by the confusion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
court, secretly procured a horse, and fled to Ferrara, thence to
Venice, from which place he returned to Nuremberg.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>The more Charles appeared irritated against Germany, the
greater moderation he showed towards the Italians: heavy
pecuniary contributions were all that he required. It was beyond
the Alps, in the centre of Christendom, by means of
these very religious controversies, that he desired to establish
his power. He pressed on, and required only two things:
behind him,&mdash;peace; with him,&mdash;money.</p>

<p>On the 5th of November he entered Bologna. Everything
was striking about him: the crowd of nobles, the splendour
of the equipages, the haughtiness of the Spanish troops, the
four thousand ducats that were scattered by handfuls among
the people;<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> but above all, the majesty and magnificence of
the young Emperor. The two chiefs of Romish Christendom
were about to meet. The Pope quitted his palace with all his
court; and Charles, at the head of an army which would
have conquered the whole of Italy in a few days, affecting
the humility of a child, fell on his knees, and kissed the
Pontiff's feet.</p>

<p>The Emperor and the Pope resided at Bologna in two adjoining
palaces, separated by a single wall, through which a
doorway had been made, of which each had a key; and the
young and politic Emperor was often seen to visit the old
and crafty Pontiff, carrying papers in his hand.</p>

<p>Clement obtained Sforza's pardon, who appeared before the
Emperor sick and leaning on a staff. Venice also was forgiven:
a million of crowns arranged these two matters.
But Charles could not obtain from the Pope the pardon of
Florence. This illustrious city was sacrificed to the Medici,
"considering," it was said, "that it is impossible for Christ's
vicar to demand anything that is unjust."</p>

<div class="sidenote">GATTINARA'S PROPOSITION.</div>

<p>The most important affair was the Reformation. Some represented
to the Emperor that, victor over all his enemies, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
should carry matters with a high hand, and constrain the
Protestants by force of arms.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Charles was more moderate;
he preferred weakening the Protestants by the Papists, and
then the Papists by the Protestants, and by this means raising
his power above them both.</p>

<p>A wiser course was nevertheless proposed in a solemn
conference. "The Church is torn in pieces," said Chancellor
Gattinara. "You (Charles) are the head of the empire:
you (the Pope) are the head of the Church. It is your duty
to provide by common accord against unprecedented wants.
Assemble the pious men of all nations, and let a free council
deduce from the Word of God a scheme of doctrine such as
may be received by every people."<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>A thunderbolt would not have so greatly startled Clement
VII. The offspring of an illegitimate union, and having obtained
the Papacy by means far from honourable, and squandered
the treasures of the Church in an unjust war, this Pontiff
had a thousand personal motives for dreading an assembly
of Christendom. "Large congregations," replied he,
"serve only to introduce popular opinions. It is not with the
decrees of councils, but with the edge of the sword, that we
should decide controversies."<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">WAR IMMINENT&mdash;LUTHER'S OBJECTIONS.</div>

<p>As Gattinara still persisted: "What!" said the Pope, angrily
interrupting him, "you dare to contradict me, and to excite
your master against me!" Charles rose up; all the assembly
preserved the profoundest silence, and the prince
having resumed his seat, seconded his chancellor's request.
Clement was satisfied with saying that he would reflect upon
it. He then began to work upon the young Emperor in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
their private conferences, and Charles promised at last to
constrain the heretics by violence, while the Pope should
summon all other princes to his aid.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> "To overcome Germany
by force, and then erase it from the surface of the
earth, is the sole object of the Italians," they wrote from
Venice to the Elector.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>Such was the sinister news which, by spreading alarm
among the Protestants, should also have united them. Unfortunately
a contrary movement was then taking place.
Luther and some of his friends had revised the Marburg articles
in a sense exclusively Lutheran, and the ministers of
the Elector of Saxony had presented them to the conference
at Schwabach. The Reformed deputies from Ulm and Strasburg
had immediately withdrawn, and the conference was
broken up.</p>

<p>But new conferences had erelong become necessary. The
express that Caden had forwarded from Piacenza had reached
Nuremberg. Every one in Germany understood that the
arrest of the princes' deputies was a declaration of war. The
Elector was staggered, and ordered his chancellor to consult
the theologians of Wittemberg.</p>

<p>"We cannot on our conscience," replied Luther on the
18th November, "approve of the proposed alliance. We
would rather die ten times than see our Gospel cause one
drop of blood to be shed.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Our part is to be like lambs of
the slaughter. The cross of Christ must be borne. Let
your highness be without fear. We shall do more by our
prayers than all our enemies by their boastings. Only let
not your hands be stained with the blood of your brethren!
If the Emperor requires us to be given up to his tribunals,
we are ready to appear. You cannot defend our faith:
each one should believe at his own risk and peril."<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">THE SAVIOUR IS COMING!</div>

<p>On the 29th November an evangelical congress was opened
at Smalkald, and an unexpected event rendered this
meeting still more important. Ehinger, Caden, and Frauentraut,
who had escaped from the grasp of Charles V., appeared
before them.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> The Landgrave had no further doubts of
the success of his plan.</p>

<p>He was deceived. No agreement between contrary doctrines,
no alliance between politics and religion&mdash;were Luther's
two principles, and they still prevailed. It was agreed
that those who felt disposed to sign the articles of Schwabach,
and those only, should meet at Nuremberg on the 6th
of January.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARLES' CONCILIATORY LANGUAGE.</div>

<p>The horizon became hourly more threatening. The Papists
of Germany wrote one to another these few but significant
words: "The Saviour is coming."<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> "Alas!" exclaimed
Luther, "what a pitiless saviour! He will devour
them all, as well as us." In effect, two Italian bishops, authorized
by Charles V., demanded in the Pope's name all the
gold and silver from the churches, and a third part of the
ecclesiastical revenues: a proceeding which caused an immense
sensation. "Let the Pope go to the devil," replied a
canon of Paderborn, a little too freely.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> "Yes, yes!" archly
replied Luther, "this is your saviour that is coming!" The
people already began to talk of frightful omens. It was not
only the living who were agitated: a child still in its mother's
womb had uttered horrible shrieks.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> "All is accomplished,"
said Luther; "the Turk has reached the highest degree
of his power, the glory of the Papacy is declining, and
the world is splitting on every side."<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> The Reformer, dreading
lest the end of the world should arrive before he had
translated all the Bible, published the prophesies of Daniel
separately,&mdash;"a work," said he, "for these latter times."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
"Historians relate," added he, "that Alexander the Great always
placed Homer under his pillow: the prophet Daniel is
worthy not only that kings and princes should wear him under
their heads, but in their hearts; for he will teach them
that the government of nations proceeds from the power of
God. We are balanced in the hand of the Lord, as a ship
upon the sea, or a cloud in the sky."<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>Yet the frightful phantom that Philip of Hesse had not
ceased to point out to his allies, and whose threatening jaws
seemed already opening, suddenly vanished, and they discovered
in its place the graceful image of the most amiable of
princes.</p>

<p>On the 21st January, Charles had summoned all the states
of the empire to Augsburg, and had endeavoured to employ
the most conciliatory language. "Let us put an end to all
discord," he said, "let us renounce our antipathies, let us offer
to our Saviour the sacrifice of all our errors, let us make it
our business to comprehend and weigh with meekness the
opinions of others. Let us annihilate all that has been said
or done on both sides contrary to right, and let us seek after
christian truth. Let us all fight under one and the same
leader, Jesus Christ, and let us strive thus to meet in one communion,
one church, and one unity."<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EMPEROR'S MOTIVES.</div>

<p>What language! How was it that this prince, who had
hitherto spoken only of the sword, should now speak only of
peace? It will be said that the wise Gattinara had had a
share in it; that the act of convocation was drawn up under
the impression of the terror caused by the Turkish invasion;
that the Emperor already saw with how little eagerness the
Roman Catholics of Germany seconded his views; that he
wished to intimidate the Pope; that this language, so full of
graciousness, was but a mask which Charles employed to deceive
his enemies; that he wished to manage religion in true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
imperial fashion, like Theodosius and Constantine, and seek
first to unite both parties by the influence of his wisdom
and of his favours, reserving to himself, if kindness should
fail, to employ force afterwards. It is possible that each of
these motives may have exercised a certain influence on
Charles, but the latter appears to us nearer the truth, and
more conformable to the character of this prince.</p>

<p>If Charles, however, gave way to inclinations of mildness,
the fanatical Ferdinand was at hand to bring him back. "I
will continue negotiating without coming to any conclusion,"
wrote he to his brother; "and should I even be reduced to
that, do not fear; pretexts will not be wanting to chastise
these rebels, and you will find men enough, who will be
happy to aid you in your revenge."<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>II. Charles, like Charlemagne in former times and Napoleon
in latter days, desired to be crowned by the Pope, and
had at first thought of visiting Rome for that purpose; but
Ferdinand's pressing letters compelled him to choose Bologna.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>
He appointed the 22d February for receiving the iron
crown as King of Lombardy, and resolved to assume the
golden crown as Emperor of the Romans on the 24th of the
same month&mdash;his birthday and the anniversary of the battle
of Pavia, and which he thought was always fortunate to
him.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CORONATION.</div>

<p>The offices of honour that belonged to the Electors of the
Empire were given to strangers: in the coronation of the
Emperor of Germany all was Spanish or Italian. The sceptre
was carried by the Marquis of Montferrat, the sword by
the Duke of Urbino, and the golden crown by the Duke of
Savoy. One single German prince of little importance, the
Count-palatine Philip, was present: he carried the orb. After
these lords came the Emperor himself between two cardinals;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
then the members of his council. All this procession
defiled across a magnificent temporary bridge erected between
the palace and the church. At the very moment the Emperor
drew near the church of San Petronio, where the coronation
was to take place, the scaffolding cracked behind him
and gave way, so that many of his train were wounded, and
the multitude fled in alarm. Charles calmly turned back
and smiled, not doubting that his lucky star had saved him.</p>

<p>At length Charles V. arrived in front of the throne on
which Clement VII. was seated. But before being made
Emperor, it was necessary that he should be promoted to the
sacred orders. The Pope presented to him the surplice and
the amice to make him a canon of St. Peter's and of St. John
Lateranus, and immediately the canons of these two churches
stripped him of his royal ornaments, and robed him with
these sacred garments. The Pope went to the altar and
began Mass; and the new canon drew near to wait upon him.
After the offertory, the imperial deacon presented the water
to the pontiff. He then knelt down between two cardinals,
and communicated from the Pope's hand. The Emperor
now returned near his throne, where the princes robed him
with the imperial mantle brought from Constantinople, all
sparkling with diamonds, and Charles humbly bent the knee
before Clement VII.</p>

<p>The pontiff, having anointed him with oil and given him
the sceptre, presented him with a naked sword, saying:
"Make use of it in defence of the Church against the enemies
of the faith!" Next taking the golden orb, studded with
jewels, which the Count-palatine held, he said: "Govern the
world with piety and firmness!" Last came the Duke of
Savoy, who carried the golden crown enriched with diamonds.
The Prince bent down, and Clement put the diadem
on his head, saying: "Charles, Emperor invincible, receive
this crown which we place on your head, as a sign to all
the earth of the authority that is conferred upon you."</p>

<p>The Emperor then kissed the white cross embroidered on
the Pope's red slipper and exclaimed: "I swear ever to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
employ all my strength to defend the Pontifical dignity, and
the Church of Rome."<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>The two princes now took their seats under the same canopy,
but on thrones of unequal height, the Emperor's being
half a foot lower than the pontiff's, and the cardinal deacon
proclaimed to the people "The invincible Emperor, Defender
of the Faith." For the next half-hour nothing was heard
but the noise of musketry, trumpets, drums, and fifes, all the
bells of the city, and the shouts of the multitude. Thus was
proclaimed anew the close union of politics with religion.
The mighty Emperor, transformed to a Roman deacon, and
humbly serving mass, like a canon of St. Peter's, had typified
and declared the indissoluble union of the Romish Church
with the State. This is one of the essential doctrines of Popery,
and one of the most striking characteristics that distinguish
it from the Evangelical and Christian Church.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, during all this ceremony the Pope seemed ill
at ease, and sighed as soon as men's eyes ceased to be turned on
him. Accordingly, the French ambassador wrote to his court
that these four months which the Emperor and Pope had spent
together at Bologna, would bear fruit of which the King of
France would assuredly have no cause to complain.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ALARM OF THE PROTESTANTS.</div>

<p>Scarcely had Charles V. risen from before the altar of San
Petronio, than he turned his face towards Germany, and
appeared on the Alps as the anointed of the Papacy. The
letter of convocation, so indulgent and benign, seemed forgotten:
all things were made new since the Pope's blessings:
there was but one thought in the imperial caravan, the necessity
of rigorous measures; and the legate Campeggio ceased
not to insinuate irritating words into Charles's ear. "At the
first rumour of the storm that threatens them," said Granvelle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
"we shall see the Protestants flying on every side, like timid
doves upon which the Alpine eagle pounces."<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>Great indeed was the alarm throughout the Empire; already
even the affrighted people, apprehensive of the greatest
disasters, repeated everywhere that Luther and Melancthon
were dead. "Alas!" said Melancthon, consumed by sorrow,
when he heard these reports, "the rumour is but too true, for
I die daily."<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> But Luther, on the contrary, boldly raising
the eye of faith towards heaven, exclaimed: "Our enemies
triumph, but erelong to perish." In truth the councils of the
Elector displayed an unheard-of boldness. "Let us collect our
troops," said they; "let us march on the Tyrol, and close the
passage of the Alps against the Emperor."<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> Philip of Hesse
uttered a cry of joy when he heard of this. The sword of
Charles has aroused his indolent allies at last. Immediately
fresh courtiers from Ferdinand were sent to hasten the arrival
of Charles, and all Germany was in expectation.</p>

<p>Before carrying out this gigantic design, the Elector desired
to consult Luther once more. The Emperor in the
midst of the Electors was only the first among his equals;
and independent princes were allowed to resist another prince,
even if he were of higher rank than themselves. But Luther,
dreading above all things the intervention of the secular
arm in church affairs, was led to reply on the 6th March
in this extraordinary manner: "Our princes' subjects are also
the Emperor's subjects, and even more so than princes are.
To protect by arms the Emperor's subjects against the Emperor,
would be as if the Burgomaster of Torgau wished to
protect by force his citizens against the Elector."</p>

<div class="sidenote">BRUCK'S NOBLE ADVICE.</div>

<p>"What must be done then?&mdash;Attend," replied Luther. "If
the Emperor desires to march against us, let no prince undertake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
our defence. God is faithful: he will not abandon
us." All preparations for war were immediately suspended,
the Landgrave received a polite refusal, and the confederation
was dissolved. It was the will of God that his cause should
appear before the Emperor without league and without soldiers,
having faith alone for its shield.</p>

<p>Never perhaps has such boldness been witnessed in feeble
and unarmed men; but never, although under an appearance
of blindness, was there so much wisdom and understanding.</p>

<p>The question next discussed in the Elector's council was,
whether he should go to the diet. The majority of the councillors
opposed it. "Is it not risking everything," said they,
"to go and shut oneself up within the walls of a city with a
powerful enemy?" Bruck and the Prince-electoral were of
a different opinion. Duty in their eyes was a better councillor
than fear. "What!" said they, "would the Emperor
insist so much on the presence of the princes at Augsburg
only to draw them into a snare? We cannot impute such
perfidy to him." The Landgrave on the contrary seconded
the opinion of the majority. "Remember Piacenza," said
he. "Some unforeseen circumstance may lead the Emperor
to take all his enemies in one cast of the net."</p>

<p>The Chancellor stood firm. "Let the princes only comport
themselves with courage," said he, "and God's cause
is saved." The decision was in favour of the nobler plan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPIRITUAL ARMOUR.</div>

<p>This diet was to be a lay council, or at the very least a national
convention.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> The Protestants foresaw that a few unimportant
concessions would be made to them at first, and
then that they would be required to sacrifice their faith. It
was therefore necessary to settle what were the essential
articles of christian truth, in order to know whether, by what
means, and how far they might come to an understanding
with their adversaries. The Elector accordingly had letters
sent on the 14th March to the four principal theologians of
Wittemberg, setting them this task, all other business being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
laid aside.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Thus, instead of collecting soldiers, this prince
drew up articles: they were the best armament.</p>

<p>Luther, Jonas, and Melancthon (Pomeranus remaining at
Wittemberg), arrived at Torgau in Easter week, asking leave
to deliver their articles in person to Charles the Fifth.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
"God forbid!" replied the Elector, "I also desire to confess
my Lord."</p>

<p>John having then confided to Melancthon the definitive
drawing up of the confession, and ordered general prayers
to be offered up, began his journey on the 3d April, with
one hundred and sixty horsemen, clad in rich scarlet cloaks
embroidered with gold.</p>

<p>Every man was aware of the dangers that threatened the
Elector, and hence many in his escort marched with downcast
eyes and sinking hearts. But Luther, full of faith, revived
the courage of his friends, by composing and singing
with his fine voice that beautiful hymn, since become so famous:
<i>Eine vaste Burg ist unser Gott</i>. Our God is a strong
tower.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> Never did soul that knew its own weakness, but
which, looking to God, despises every fear, find such noble
accents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER REMAINS AT COBURG.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>This hymn was sung during the diet, not only at Augsburg,
but in all the churches of Saxony, and its energetic
strains were often seen to revive and inspirit the most dejected
minds.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>On Easter-eve the troop reached Coburg, and on the 23d
April the Elector resumed his journey; but at the very moment
of departure Luther received an order to remain.
"Some one has said, Hold your tongue, you have a harsh
voice," wrote he to one of his friends.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> He submitted however
without hesitation, setting an example of that passive
obedience which he advocated so boldly. The Elector feared
that Luther's presence would still further exasperate his adversaries,
and drive Charles to extreme measures: the city
of Augsburg had also written to him to that effect. But at
the same time John was anxious to keep the Reformer within
reach, that he might be able to consult him. He was therefore
left at Coburg, in the castle overlooking the town and
the river Itz, in the upper story on the south side. It was
from this place he wrote those numerous letters dated from
the <i>region of birds</i>; and it was there that for many months he
had to maintain with his old enemy of the Wartburg, Satan,
a struggle full of darkness and of anguish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARLES AT INNSPRUCK.</div>

<p>On the 2d May the Elector reached Augsburg; it had
been expected that he would stay away, and, to the great astonishment
of all, he was the first at the rendezvous.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> He
immediately sent Dolzig, marshal of the court, to meet the
Emperor and to compliment him. On the 12th May, Philip
of Hesse, who had at last resolved on not separating himself
from his ally, arrived with an escort of one hundred and
ninety horsemen; and almost at the same time the Emperor
entered Innspruck, in the Tyrol, accompanied by his brother,
the queens of Hungary and Bohemia, the ambassadors of
France, England, and Portugal, Campeggio the papal legate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and other cardinals, with many princes and nobles of Germany,
Spain, and Italy.</p>

<p>How bring back the heretics to obedience to the Church?
Such was the great topic of conversation in this brilliant court
among nobles and priests, ladies and soldiers, councillors
and ambassadors. They, or Charles at least, were not for
making them ascend the scaffold, but they wished to act in
such a manner that, untrue to their faith, they should bend
the knee to the Pope. Charles stopped at Innspruck to study
the situation of Germany, and ensure the success of his
schemes.</p>

<p>Scarcely was his arrival known when a crowd of people,
high and low, flocked round him on every side, and more
than 270,000 crowns, previously raised in Italy, served to
make the Germans understand the justice of Rome's cause.
"All these heretics," was the cry, "will fall to the ground
and crawl to the feet of the Pope."<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>Charles did not think so. He was, on the contrary, astonished
to see what power the Reformation had gained. He
momentarily even entertained the idea of leaving Augsburg
alone, and of going straight to Cologne, and there proclaiming
his brother King of the Romans.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> Thus, religious interests
would have given way to dynastic interests, at least
so ran the report. But Charles the Fifth did not stop at this
idea. The question of the Reformation was there before him,
increasing hourly in strength, and it could not be eluded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SENTIMENTS OF GATTINARA.</div>

<p>Two parties divided the imperial court. The one, numerous
and active, called upon the Emperor to revive simply
the edict of Worms, and, without hearing the Protestants,
condemn their cause.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> The legate was at the head of this
party. "Do not hesitate," said he to Charles; "confiscate
their property, establish the inquisition, and punish these obstinate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
heretics with fire and sword."<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> The Spaniards, who
strongly seconded these exhortations, gave way to their accustomed
debauchery, so that many of them were arrested
for seduction.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> This was a sad specimen of the faith that
they wished to impose on Germany. Rome has always
thought lightly of morality.</p>

<p>Gattinara, although sick, had painfully followed in Charles's
train to neutralize the influence of the legate. A determined
adversary of the Roman policy, he thought that the Protestants
might render important services to Christendom.
"There is nothing I desire so much," said he, "as to see the
Elector of Saxony and his allies persevere courageously in
the profession of the Gospel, and call for a free religious council.
If they allow themselves to be checked by promises or
threats, I hesitate myself, I stagger, and I doubt of the means
of salvation."<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> The enlightened and honest members of
the Papal Church (and of whom there is always a small
number) necessarily sympathize with the Reformation.</p>

<p>Charles V., exposed to these contrary influences, desired to
restore Germany to religious unity by his personal intervention:
for a moment he thought himself on the eve of success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PIETY OF THE ELECTOR.</div>

<p>Amongst the persons who crowded to Innspruck was the
unfortunate Christian, king of Denmark, Charles's brother-in-law.
In vain had he proposed to his subjects undertaking
a pilgrimage to Rome in expiation of the cruelties of which
he was accused: his people had expelled him. Having repaired
to Saxony, to his uncle the Elector, he had there
heard Luther, and had embraced the evangelical doctrines,
as far at least as external profession goes. This poor dethroned
king could not resist the eloquence of the powerful ruler
of two worlds, and Christian, won over by Charles the Fifth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
publicly placed himself again under the sceptre of the Roman
hierarchy. All the papal party uttered a shout of triumph.
Nothing equals their credulity, and the importance they
attach to such valueless accessions. "I cannot describe the
emotion with which this news has filled me," wrote Clement
VII. to Charles, his hand trembling with joy; "the brightness
of your Majesty's virtues begins at last to scatter the darkness:
this example will lead to numberless conversions."</p>

<p>Things were in this state, when Duke George of Saxony,
Duke William of Bavaria, and the Elector Joachim of
Brandenburg, the three German princes who were the greatest
enemies of the Reformation, hastily arrived at Innspruck.</p>

<p>The tranquillity of the Elector, whom they had seen at
Augsburg, had alarmed them, for they knew not the source
whence John derived his courage; they imagined that he was
revolving in his mind some perfidious design. "It is not
without reason," said they to Charles, "that the Elector John
has repaired the first to Augsburg, and that he appeared
there with a considerable train: he wishes to seize your person.
Act then with energy, and allow us to offer your Majesty
a guard of six thousand horse."<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> Conference upon conference
immediately took place. The Protestants were affrighted.
"They are holding a diet at Innspruck," said Melancthon,
"on the best means of having our heads."<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> But
Gattinara prevailed on Charles to preserve his neutrality.</p>

<p>While all was thus agitated in the Tyrol, the Evangelical
Christians, instead of mustering in arms, as they were accused,
sent up their prayers to heaven, and the Protestant princes
were preparing to render an account of their faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WILES OF THE ROMANISTS.</div>

<p>The Elector of Saxony held the first rank among them.
Sincere, upright, and pure from his youth, early disgusted with
the brilliant tourneys in which he had at first taken part, John
of Saxony had joyfully hailed the day of the Reformation,
and the Gospel light had gradually penetrated his serious and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
reflective mind. His great pleasure was to have the Holy
Scriptures read to him during the latter hours of the day. It
is true that, having arrived at an advanced age, the pious
Elector sometimes fell asleep, but he soon awoke with a start,
and repeated the last passage aloud. Although moderate and
a friend of peace, he yet possessed an energy that was powerfully
aroused by the great interests of the faith. There is no
prince in the sixteenth century, and none perhaps since the
primitive times of the Church, who has done so much as John
of Saxony for the cause of the Gospel. Accordingly it was
against him that the first efforts of the Papists were directed.</p>

<p>In order to gain him over, they wished to put in operation
very different tactics from those which had been previously
employed. At Spire the Evangelicals had met with angry
looks in every quarter; at Augsburg, on the contrary, the
Papists gave them a hearty welcome; they represented as
very trifling the distance that separated the two parties, and
in their private conversations uttered the mildest language,
"seeking thus to make the credulous Protestants take the bait,"
says an historian.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> The latter yielded with simplicity to
these skilful man&oelig;uvres.</p>

<p>Charles the Fifth was convinced that the simple Germans
would not be able to resist his star. "The King of Denmark
has been converted," said his courtiers to him, "why should
not the Elector follow his example? Let us draw him into
the imperial atmosphere." John was immediately invited to
come and converse familiarly with the Emperor at Innspruck,
with an assurance that he might reckon on Charles's particular
favour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AUGSBURG.</div>

<p>The Prince-electoral, John Frederick, who on seeing the
advances of the Papists had at first exclaimed: "We conduct
our affairs with such awkwardness, that it is quite pitiable!"
allowed himself to be caught by this stratagem. "The
Papist princes," said he to his father, "exert every means of
blackening our characters. Go to Innspruck in order to put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
a stop to these underhand practices; or if you are unwilling,
send me in your place."</p>

<p>This time the prudent Elector moderated his son's precipitancy,
and replied to Charles's ministers, that it was not proper
to treat of the affairs of the diet in any other place than
that which the Emperor had himself appointed, and he begged,
in consequence, that his majesty would hasten his arrival.
This was the first check that Charles met with.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>III. Meantime Augsburg was filling more and more every
day. Princes, bishops, deputies, gentlemen, cavaliers, soldiers
in rich uniforms, entered by every gate, and thronged the
streets, the public places, inns, churches, and palaces. All
that was most magnificent in Germany was there about to
be collected. The critical circumstances in which the empire
and Christendom were placed, the presence of Charles
V. and his kindly manners, the love of novelty, of grand
shows, and of lively emotions, tore the Germans from their
homes. All those who had great interests to discuss, without
reckoning a crowd of idlers, flocked from the various provinces
of the empire, and hastily made their way towards this illustrious
city.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GOSPEL PREACHED.</div>

<p>In the midst of this crowd the Elector and the Landgrave
were resolved to confess Jesus Christ, and to take advantage
of this convocation in order to convert the empire. Scarcely
had John arrived when he ordered one of his theologians to
preach daily with open doors in the church of the Dominicans.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
On Sunday the 8th May, the same was done in the
church of St. Catherine; on the 13th, Philip of Hesse opened
the gates of the cathedral, and his chaplain Snepff there
preached the Word of Salvation; and on the following Sunday
(May 15) this prince ordered Cellarius, minister of Augsburg
and a follower of Zwingle, to preach in the same temple.
Somewhat later the Landgrave firmly settled himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
in the church of St. Ulric, and the Elector in that of St.
Catherine. These were the two positions taken up by these
illustrious princes. Every day the Gospel was preached in
these places before an immense and attentive crowd.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>The partisans of Rome were amazed. They expected to
see criminals endeavouring to dissemble their faults, and they
met with confessors of Christ with uplifted heads and words
of power. Desirous of counterbalancing these preachings,
the Bishop of Augsburg ordered his suffragan and his chaplain
to ascend the pulpit. But the Romish priests understood
better how to say Mass than to preach the Gospel. "They
shout, they bawl," said some. "They are stupid fellows,"
added all their hearers, shrugging their shoulders.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>The Romanists, ashamed of their own priests, began to
grow angry,<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> and unable to hold their ground by preaching,
they had recourse to the secular arm. "The priests are setting
wondrous machines at work to gain Cæsar's mind,"
said Melancthon.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> They succeeded, and Charles made known
his displeasure at the hardihood of the princes. The friends
of the Pope then drew near the Protestants and whispered
into their ears "that the Emperor, victor over the King of
France and the Roman Pontiff, would appear in Germany to
crush all the Gospellers."<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> The anxious Elector demanded
the advice of his theologians.</p>

<p>Before the answer was ready, Charles's orders arrived, carried
by two of his most influential ministers, the Counts of
Nassau and of Nuenar. A more skilful choice could not have
been made. These two nobles, although devoted to Charles,
were favourable to the Gospel, which they professed not long
after. The Elector was therefore fully disposed to listen to
their counsel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EMPEROR'S MESSAGE.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>On the 24th May, the two Counts delivered their letters
to John of Saxony, and declared to him that the Emperor
was exceedingly grieved that religious controversies should
disturb the good understanding that had for so many years
united the houses of Saxony and Austria;<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> that he was astonished
at seeing the Elector oppose an edict (that of Worms)
which had been unanimously passed by all the states of the
Empire; that the alliances he had made tended to tear asunder
the unity of Germany, and might inundate it with blood.
They required at last that the Elector would immediately put
a stop to the evangelical preachings, and added, in a confidential
tone, that they trembled at the thought of the immediate
and deplorable consequences that would certainly follow
the Elector's refusal. "This," said they, "is only the expression
of our own personal sentiments." It was a diplomatic
man&oelig;uvre, the Emperor having enjoined them to give
utterance to a few threats, but that solely on their own account.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>The Elector was greatly agitated. "If his majesty forbids
the preaching of the Gospel," exclaimed he, "I shall immediately
return home."<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> He waited however for the advice of
his theologians.</p>

<p>Luther's answer was ready first. "The Emperor is our master,"
said he; "the town and all that is in it belong to him.
If your Highness should give orders at Torgau for this to be
done, and for that to be left undone, the people ought not to
resist. I should prefer endeavouring to change his majesty's
decision by humble and respectful solicitations; but if he persists,
might makes right; we have but done our duty."<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>
Thus spoke the man who has often been represented as a
rebel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FIRMNESS OF THE ELECTOR.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>Melancthon and the others were nearly of the same opinion;
only they insisted more on the necessity of representing
to the Emperor "that they did not speak of controversy in

of Christ the Saviour.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Let us beware, above all," continued

ways you have attained to a right understanding of the
truth,<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> and do not allow yourself to be alarmed at these thunder-claps
that fall from the lips of our enemies." To confess
the truth, such was the object to which, according to the Reformers,
everything else should be subordinate.</p>

<p>Will the Elector yield to this first demand of Charles, and
thus begin, even before the Emperor's arrival, that list of sacrifices,
the end of which cannot be foreseen?</p>

<p>No one in Augsburg was firmer than John. In vain did
the Reformers represent that they were in the Emperor's city,
and only strangers:<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> the Elector shook his head. Melancthon
in despair wrote to Luther: "Alas! how untractable is our
old man!"<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> Nevertheless he again returned to the charge.
Fortunately there was an intrepid man at the Elector's right
hand, the chancellor Bruck, who feeling convinced that policy,
honour, and above all, duty, bound the friends of the Reformation
to resist the menaces of Charles, said to the Elector:
"The Emperor's demand is but a worthy beginning to bring
about the definitive abolition of the Gospel.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> If we yield at
present, they will crush us by and by. Let us therefore humbly
beg his majesty to permit the continuance of the sermons."
Thus, at that time, a statesman stood in the foremost rank of
the confessors of Jesus Christ. This is one of the characteristic
features of this great age, and it must not be forgotten, if
we would understand its history aright.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ELECTOR'S REPLY.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>On the 31st May, the Elector sent his answer in writing to
Charles's ministers. "It is not true," it bore, "that the Edict
of Worms was approved of by the six Electors. How could
the Elector, my brother, and myself, by approving it, have opposed
the everlasting word of Almighty God? Accordingly,
succeeding diets have declared this edict impossible to be executed.
As for the relations of friendship that I have formed,
their only aim is to protect me against acts of violence. Let
my accusers lay before the eyes of his majesty the alliances
they have made; I am ready to produce mine, and the Emperor
shall decide between us.&mdash;Finally, As to the demand
to suspend our preachings, nothing is proclaimed in them but
the glorious truth of God, and never was it so necessary to us.
We cannot therefore do without it!"<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>This reply must necessarily hasten the arrival of Charles;
and it was urgent they should be prepared to receive him.
To explain what they believe, and then be silent, was the
whole plan of the Protestant campaign. A confession was
therefore necessary. One man, of small stature, frail, timid,
and in great alarm, was commissioned to prepare this instrument
of war. Philip Melancthon worked at it night and
day: he weighed every expression, softened it down, changed
it, and then frequently returned to his first idea. He was
wasting away his strength; his friends trembled lest he should
die over his task; and Luther enjoined him, as early as the
12th of May, under pain of anathema, to take measures for
the preservation of "his little body," and not "to commit suicide
for the love of God."<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> "God is as usefully served by
repose," added he, "and indeed man never serves him better
than by keeping himself tranquil. It is for this reason God
willed that the Sabbath should be so strictly observed."<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PREPARATION OF THE CONFESSION.</div>

<p>Notwithstanding these solicitations, Melancthon's application
augmented, and he set about an exposition of the christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
faith, at once mild, moderate, and as little removed as
possible from the doctrine of the Latin Church. At Coburg
he had already put his hand to the task, and traced out in
the first part the doctrines of the faith, according to the articles
of Schwabach; and in the second, the abuses of the
Church, according to the articles of Torgau, making altogether
quite a new work. At Augsburg he gave a more
correct and elegant form to this confession.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>The Apology, as it was then called, was completed on the
11th May; and the Elector sent it to Luther, begging him
to mark what ought to be changed. "I have said what I
thought most useful," added Melancthon, who feared that his
friend would find the confession too weak; "for Eck ceases
not to circulate against us the most diabolical calumnies, and
I have endeavoured to oppose an antidote to his poisons."<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>Luther replied to the Elector on the 15th May: "I have
read Magister Philip's Apology; I like it well enough, I have
no corrections to make. Besides, that would hardly suit me,
for I cannot walk so meekly and so silently. May Christ
our Lord grant that this work may produce much and great
fruit."</p>

<p>Each day, however, the Elector's councillors and theologians,
in concert with Melancthon, improved the confession,
and endeavoured to render it such that the charmed diet
should, in its own despite, hear it to the very end.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S SINAI.</div>

<p>While the struggle was thus preparing at Augsburg, Luther
at Coburg, on the summit of the hill, "on his Sinai," as
he called it, raised his hands like Moses towards heaven.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>
He was the real general of the spiritual war that was then
waging; his letters ceased not to bear to the combatants the
directions which they needed, and numerous pamphlets issuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
from his stronghold, like discharges of musketry, spread
confusion in the enemy's camp.</p>

<p>The place where he had been left was, by its solitude,
favourable to study and to meditation.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> "I shall make a
Zion of this Sinai," said he on the 22d April, "and I shall
build here three tabernacles; one to the Psalms, one to the
Prophets, and one&mdash;&mdash;to Esop!" This last word is a
startling one. The association belongs neither to the language
nor the spirit of the Apostles. It is true that Esop
was not to be his principal study: the fables were soon laid
aside, and truth alone engaged Luther. "I shall weep, I
shall pray, I shall never be silent," wrote he, "until I know
that my cry has been heard in heaven."<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>Besides, by way of relaxation, he had something better
than Esop; he had those domestic joys whose precious treasures
the Reformation had opened to the ministers of the Word.
It was at this time he wrote that charming letter to his infant
son, in which he describes a delightful garden where children
dressed in gold are sporting about, picking up apples, pears,
cherries, and plums; they sing, dance, and enjoy themselves,
and ride pretty little horses, with golden bridles and silver
saddles.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S MERRIMENT.</div>

<p>But the Reformer was soon drawn away from these pleasing
images. About this time he learnt that his father had
gently fallen asleep in the faith which is in Jesus Christ.
"Alas!" exclaimed he, shedding tears of filial love, "it is by
the sweat of his brow that he made me what I am."<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> Other
trials assailed him; and to bodily pains were added the phantoms
of his imagination. One night in particular he saw three
torches pass rapidly before his eyes, and at the same moment
he heard claps of thunder in his head, which he ascribed to the
devil. His servant ran in at the moment he fainted, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
having restored him to animation, read to him the Epistle to
the Galatians. Luther, who had fallen asleep, said as he
awoke: "Come, and despite of the devil let us sing the Psalm,
<i>Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord</i>." They
both sang the hymn. While Luther was thus tormented by
these internal noises, he translated the prophet Jeremiah, and
yet he often deplored his idleness.</p>

<p>He soon devoted himself to other studies, and poured out
the floods of his irony on the mundane practices of courts.
He saw Venice, the Pope, and the King of France, giving
their hands to Charles V. to crush the Gospel. Then, alone
in his chamber in the old castle, he burst into irresistible
laughter. "Mr. <i>Par-ma-foy</i>, (it was thus he designated Francis
I.), <i>Innomine-Domini</i> (the Pope), and the Republic of Venice,
pledge their goods and their bodies to the Emperor......<i>Sanctissimum
f&oelig;dus</i>. A most holy alliance truly! This league
between these four powers belongs to the chapter <i>Non-credimus</i>,
Venice, the Pope, and France become <i>imperialists</i>!......But
these are three persons in one substance, filled with unspeakable
hatred against the Emperor. Mr. <i>Par-ma-foy</i> cannot
forget his defeat at Pavia; Mr. <i>In-nomine-Domini</i> is, 1st,
an Italian, which is already too much; 2d, a Florentine,
which is worse; 3d, a bastard&mdash;that is to say, a child of the
devil; 4th, he will never forget the disgrace of the sack of
Rome. As for the Venetians, they are Venetians: that is quite
enough; and they have good reason to avenge themselves
on the posterity of Maximilian. All this belongs to the chapter
<i>Firmiter-credimus</i>. But God will help the pious Charles,
who is a sheep among wolves. Amen."<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> The former monk
of Erfurth had a surer political foresight than many diplomatists
of his age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONDITION OF SAXONY.</div>

<p>Impatient at seeing the diet put off from day to day, Luther
formed his resolution, and ended by convoking it even at Coburg.
"We are already in full assembly," wrote he on the
28th April and the 9th May. "You might here see kings,
dukes, and other grandees, deliberating on the affairs of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
kingdom, and with indefatigable voice publishing their dogmas
and decrees in the air. They dwell not in those caverns
which you decorate with the name of palaces; the heavens are
their canopy; the leafy trees form a floor of a thousand colours,
and their walls are the ends of the earth. They have a
horror of all the unmeaning luxury of silk and gold; they
ask neither coursers nor armour, and have all the same clothing
and the same colour. I have neither seen nor heard their
emperor; but if I can understand them, they have determined
this year to make a pitiless war upon&mdash;&mdash;the most excellent
fruits of the earth.&mdash;Ah! my dear friends," said he to his
messmates,<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> to whom he was writing, "these are the sophists,
the Papists, who are assembled before me in a heap, to make
me hear their sermons and their cries."&mdash;These two letters,
dated from the "<i>empire of ravens and crows</i>," finish in the following
mournful strain, which shows us the Reformer descending
into himself after this play of his imagination:
"Enough of jesting!&mdash;jesting which is, however, sometimes
necessary to dispel the gloomy thoughts that prey upon me."<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">TRAVAIL OF THE GOSPEL.</div>

<p>Luther soon returned to real life, and thrilled with joy at
beholding the fruits that the Reformation was already bearing,
and which were for him a more powerful "apology"
than even the confession of Melancthon. "Is there in the
whole world a single country to be compared to your highness's
states," wrote he to the Elector, "and which possesses
preachers of so pure a doctrine, or pastors so fitted to bring
about the reign of peace? Where do we see, as in Saxony,
boys and girls well instructed in the Holy Scriptures and in
the Catechism, increasing in wisdom and in stature, praying,
believing, talking of God and of Christ better than has been
done hitherto by all the universities, convents, and chapters
of Christendom?"<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> "My dear Duke John, says the Lord to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
you, I commend this paradise to thee, the most beautiful that
exists in the world, that thou mayst be its gardener." And
then he added: "Alas! the madness of the Papist princes
changes this paradise of God into a dirty slough, and corrupting
the youth, peoples every day with real devils their states,
their tables, and their palaces."</p>

<p>Luther, not content with encouraging his prince, desired
also to frighten his adversaries. It was with this intent that
he wrote at that time an address to the members of the
clergy assembled at Augsburg. A crowd of thoughts, like
lansquenets armed cap-a-pié, "rushed in to fatigue and bewilder
him;"<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> and in fact there is no want of barbed words
in the discourse he addresses to the bishops. "In short,"
said he to them in conclusion, "we know and you know that
we have the Word of God, and that you have it not. O
Pope! if I live I shall be a pestilence to thee; and if I die,
I shall be thy death!"<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>Thus was Luther present at Augsburg, although invisible;
and he effected more by his words and by his prayers than
Agricola, Brenz, or Melancthon. These were the days of
travail for the Gospel truth. It was about to appear in the
world with a might that was destined to eclipse all that had
been done since the time of St. Paul; but Luther only announced
and manifested the things that God was effecting:
he did not execute them himself. He was, as regards the
events of the Church, what Socrates was to philosophy: "I
imitate my mother (she was a midwife)," this philosopher was
in the habit of saying; "she does not travail herself, but she
aids others." Luther&mdash;and he never ceased repeating it&mdash;has
created nothing; but he has brought to light the precious
seed, hidden for ages in the bosom of the Church. The
man of God is not he who seeks to form his age according to
his own peculiar ideas, but he who, distinctly perceiving
God's truth, such as it is found in his Word, and as it is hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
in his Church, brings it to his contemporaries with courage
and decision.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HUMAN HOPES FAIL.</div>

<p>Never had these qualities been more necessary, for matters
were taking an alarming aspect. On the 4th June died
Chancellor Gattinara, who was to Charles the Fifth "what
Ulpian was to Alexander Severus," says Melancthon, and
with him all the human hopes of the Protestants vanished.
"It is God," Luther had said, "who has raised up for us a
Naaman in the court of the King of Syria." In truth Gattinara
alone resisted the Pope. When Charles brought to
him the objections of Rome: "Remember," said the Chancellor,
"that you are master!" Henceforward every thing
seemed to take a new direction. The Pope required that
Charles should be satisfied with being his "lictor," as Luther
says, to carry out his judgments against the heretics.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> Eck,
whose name (according to Melancthon) was no bad imitation
of the cry of Luther's crows, heaped one upon another<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> a
multitude of pretended heretical propositions, extracted from
the Reformer's writings. There were <i>four hundred and four</i>,
and yet he made excuse that, being taken unawares, he
was forced to restrict himself to so small a number, and he
called loudly for a disputation with the Lutherans. They retorted
on these propositions by a number of ironical and
biting theses on "wine, Venus, and baths, against John Eck;"
and the poor Doctor became the laughing-stock of everybody.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CHURCH, THE JUDGE.</div>

<p>But others went to work more skilfully than he. Cochl&oelig;us,
who became chaplain to Duke George of Saxony in 1527,
begged an interview with Melancthon, "for," added he, "I
cannot converse with your married ministers."<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> Melancthon,
who was looked upon with an evil eye at Augsburg, and who
had complained of being more solitary there than Luther in
his castle,<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> was touched by this courtesy, and was still more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
fully penetrated with the idea that things should be ordered in
the mildest manner possible.</p>

<p>The Romish priests and laymen made a great uproar, because
on fast days meat was usually eaten at the Elector's
court. Melancthon advised his prince to restrain the liberty
of his attendants in this respect. "This disorder," said he,
"far from leading the simple-minded to the Gospel, scandalizes
them." He added, in his ill-humour: "A fine holiness
truly, to make it a matter of conscience to fast, and yet to
be night and day given up to wine and folly!"<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> The Elector
did not yield to Melancthon's advice; it would have been
a mark of weakness of which his adversaries would have
known how to take advantage.</p>

<p>On the 31st May, the Saxon confession was at length communicated
to the other Protestant states, who required that it
should be presented in common in the name of them all.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>
But at the same time they desired to make their reservations
with regard to the influence of the state. "It is to a council
that we appeal," said Melancthon; "we will not receive the
Emperor as our judge; the ecclesiastical constitutions themselves
forbid him to pronounce in spiritual matters.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> Moses
declares that it is not the civil magistrate who decides, but the
sons of Levi. St. Paul also says (1 Cor. xiv.), '<i>let the others
judge</i>,' which cannot be understood except of an entire christian
assembly; and the Saviour himself gives us this commandment:
'<i>Tell it unto the Church</i>.' We pledge, therefore,
our obedience to the Emperor in all civil matters; but as for
the Word of God, it is liberty that we demand."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LANDGRAVE'S CATHOLIC SPIRIT.</div>

<p>All were agreed on this point; but the dissent came from
another quarter. The Lutherans feared to compromise their
cause if they went hand in hand with the Zwinglians.
"This is Lutheran madness," replied Bucer: "it will perish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of its own weight."<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> But, far from allowing this madness
"to perish," the reformed augmented the disunion by exaggerated
complaints. "In Saxony they are beginning to sing
Latin hymns again," said they; "the sacred vestments are resumed,
and oblations are called for anew.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> We would rather
be led to slaughter, than be Christians after that fashion."</p>

<p>The afflicted Landgrave, says Bucer, was "between the
hammer and the anvil;" and his allies caused him more uneasiness
than his enemies.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> He applied to Rhegius, to Brenz,
to Melancthon, declaring that it was his most earnest wish
to see concord prevail among all the Evangelical doctors. "If
these fatal doctrines are not opposed," replied Melancthon,
"there will be rents in the Church that will last to the end
of the world. Do not the Zwinglians boast of their full coffers,
of having soldiers prepared, and of foreign nations disposed
to aid them? Do they not talk of sharing among them
the rights and the property of the bishops, and of proclaiming
liberty......Good God! shall we not think of posterity,
which, if we do not repress these guilty seditions, will
be at once without throne and without altar?"<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>&mdash;"No, no!
we are one," replied this generous prince, who was so much
in advance of his age; "we all confess the same Christ, we
all profess that we must eat Jesus Christ, by faith, in the Eucharist.
Let us unite." All was unavailing. The time in
which true catholicity was to replace this sectarian spirit, of
which Rome is the most perfect expression, had not yet arrived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AUGSBURG.</div>

<p>IV. In proportion as the Emperor drew near Augsburg,
the anxieties of the Protestants continued increasing. The
burghers of this imperial city expected to see it become the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
theatre of strange events. Accordingly they said that if the
Elector, the Landgrave, and other friends of the Reformation
were not in the midst of them, they would all desert it.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> "A
great destruction threatens us," was repeated on every side.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>
A haughty expression of Charles above all disquieted the Protestants.
"What do these Electors want with me?" he had
said impatiently; "I shall do what I please!"<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> Thus arbitrary
rule was the imperial law destined to prevail in the diet.</p>

<p>To this agitation of men's minds was added the agitation
of the streets, or rather one led to the other. Masons and
locksmiths were at work in all the public places and crossings,
laboriously fastening barriers and chains to the walls,
that might be closed or stretched at the first cry of alarm.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>
At the same time about eight hundred foot and horse soldiers
were seen patrolling the streets, dressed in velvet and silk,<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>
whom the magistrates had enrolled in order to receive the
Emperor with magnificence.</p>

<p>Matters were in this state, and it was about the middle of
May, when a number of Spanish quartermasters arrived, full
of arrogance, and who looked with contemptuous eyes on
these wretched burghers, entered their houses, conducted
themselves with violence, and even rudely tore down the
arms of some of the princes.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> The magistrates having delegated
councillors to treat with them, the Spaniards made an
insolent reply. "Alas!" said the citizens, "if the servants
are so, what will their master be?" The ministers of Charles
were grieved at their impertinence, and sent a German quartermaster
who employed the forms of German politeness to
make them forget this Spanish haughtiness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARLES AT MUNICH.</div>

<p>That did not last long, and they soon felt more serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
alarm. The Council of Augsburg were asked what was the
meaning of these chains and soldiers, and they were ordered,
in the Emperor's name, to take down the one and disband
the other. The magistrates of the city answered, in alarm,
"For more than ten years past we have intended putting up
these chains;<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> and as for the soldiers, our object is simply to
pay due honour to his majesty." After many parleys it was
agreed to dismiss the troops, and that the imperial commanders
should select afresh a thousand men, who should make
oath to the Emperor, but be paid by the city of Augsburg.</p>

<p>The imperial quartermasters then resumed all their impertinence;
and no longer giving themselves the trouble of entering
the houses, and the shops, they tore down the signboards
of the Augsburg citizens, and wrote in their place how
many men and horses they would be required to lodge.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<p>Such were the preludes to the work of conciliation that
Charles V. had announced, and that he was so slow in beginning.
Accordingly his delay, attributed by some to the
crowds of people who surrounded him with their acclamations;
by others, to the solicitations of the priests, who opposed
his entry into Augsburg until he had imposed silence on the
ministers; and by others, finally, to the lessons the Pope had
given him in the arts of policy and stratagem,<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> still more estranged
the Elector and his allies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARLES AND THE PRINCES.</div>

<p>At last Charles, having quitted Innspruck two days after
Gattinara's death, arrived at Munich on the 10th June. His
reception was magnificent. At the distance of two miles
from the town a temporary fortress, soldiers' huts, cannon,
horsemen, an assault, repeated explosions, flames, shouts,
whirlwinds of smoke, and a terrible clashing of arms, all of
which was very agreeable to the Emperor;<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> in the city, theatres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
raised in the open air, the <i>Jewess Esther</i>, the <i>Persian
Cambyses</i>, and other pieces not less famous, the whole combined
with splendid fireworks, formed the reception given by the
adherents of the Pope to him whom they styled their Saviour.</p>

<p>Charles was not far distant from Augsburg. As early as
the 11th June, every day and every hour, members of the imperial
household, carriages, waggons, and baggage entered this
city, to the sound of the clacking whip and of the horn;<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> and
the burghers in amazement gazed with dejected eyes on all
this insolent train, that fell upon their city like a flight of
locusts.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>At five o'clock in the morning of the 15th June,<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> the
Elector, the princes, and their councillors, assembled at the
town-hall, and erelong arrived the imperial commissaries,
having an order for them to go out and meet Charles. At
three in the afternoon the princes and deputies quitted the
city, and, having reached a little bridge across the river Lech,
they there halted and waited for the Emperor. The eyes of
every member of the brilliant assemblage, thus stopping on
the smiling banks of an alpine torrent, were directed along
the road to Munich. At length, after waiting two or three
hours, clouds of dust and a loud noise announced the Emperor.
Two thousand of the imperial guard marched first;
then Charles having come to within fifty paces of the river,
the Electors and princes alighted. Their sons, who had advanced
beyond the bridge, perceiving the Emperor preparing
to do the same, ran to him and begged him to remain on
horseback;<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> but Charles dismounted without hesitating,<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> and
approaching the princes with an amiable smile, shook hands
with them cordially. Albert of Mentz, in his quality of arch-chancellor
of the empire, now welcomed the Emperor, and
the Count-palatine Frederick replied in behalf of Charles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">THE PROCESSION.</div>

<p>While this was passing, three individuals remained apart
on a little elevation;<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> these were the Roman Legate, proudly
seated on a mule, glittering with purple, and accompanied by
two other cardinals, the Archbishop of Salzburg and the Bishop
of Trent. The Nuncio, beholding all these great personages
on the road, raised his hands, and gave them his blessing.
Immediately the Emperor, the King, and the princes who submitted
to the Pope, fell on their knees; the Spaniards, Italians,
Netherlanders, and Germans in their train, imitated their
movements, casting however a side glance on the Protestants,
who, in the midst of this humbly prostrate crowd, alone remained
standing.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> Charles did not appear to notice this, but
he doubtless understood what it meant. The Elector of
Brandenburg then delivered a Latin speech to the legate.
He had been selected because he spoke this language better
than the princes of the Church; and accordingly, Charles,
when praising his eloquence, slily put in a word about the
negligence of the prelates.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> The Emperor now prepared to
remount his horse, when the prince-electoral of Saxony, and
the young princes of Luneburg, Mecklenburg, Brandenburg,
and Anhalt rushed towards him to aid him in getting into his
saddle: one held the bridle, another the stirrup, and all were
charmed at the magnificent appearance of their powerful sovereign.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
The procession began to move on.</p>

<p>First came two companies of lansquenets, commanded by
Simon Seitz, a citizen of Augsburg, who had made the
campaign of Italy, and was returning home laden with gold.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>
Next advanced the households of the six electors, composed
of princes, counts, councillors, gentlemen, and soldiers; the
household of the Dukes of Bavaria had slipped into their
ranks, and the four hundred and fifty horsemen that composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
it marched five abreast, covered with bright cuirasses, wearing
red doublets, while over their heads floated handsome
many-coloured plumes.&mdash;Bavaria was already in this age the
main support of Rome in Germany.</p>

<p>Immediately after came the households of the Emperor and
of his brother, in striking contrast with this warlike show.
They were composed of Turkish, Polish, Arabian, and other
led horses; then followed a multitude of young pages, clad
in yellow or red velvet, with Spanish, Bohemian, and Austrian
nobles in robes of silk and velvet;<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> among these the
Bohemians had the most martial air, and skilfully rode their
superb and prancing coursers. Last the trumpeters, drummers,
heralds, grooms, footmen, and the legate's cross-bearers,
announced the approach of the princes.</p>

<p>In fact these powerful lords, whose contentions had so often
filled Germany with confusion and war, now advanced riding
peacefully side by side. After the princes appeared the electors;
and the Elector of Saxony, according to custom, carried
the naked and glittering imperial sword immediately before
the Emperor.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>Last came the Prince, on whom all eyes were fixed.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>
Thirty years of age, of distinguished port and pleasing features,
robed in golden garments that glittered all over with
precious stones,<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> wearing a small Spanish hat on the crown
of his head,<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> mounted on a beautiful Polish hackney of the
most brilliant whiteness, riding beneath a rich canopy of red,
white, and green damask borne by six senators of Augsburg,
and casting around him looks in which gentleness was mingled
with gravity, Charles excited the liveliest enthusiasm, and
every one exclaimed that he was the handsomest man in the
empire, as well as the mightiest prince in the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENTERS AUGSBURG.</div>

<p>He had at first desired to place his brother and the legate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
at his side; but the Elector of Mentz, followed by two hundred
guards arrayed in silk, had claimed the Emperor's right
hand; and the Elector of Cologne, with a hundred well-armed
followers, had taken his station on the left. King Ferdinand
and the legate were compelled to take their places behind
them, followed by the cardinals, ambassadors, and prelates,
among whom was remarked the haughty Bishop of Osma,
the Emperor's confessor. The imperial cavalry and the
troops of Augsburg closed the procession.</p>

<p>Never, according to the historians, had anything so magnificent
been seen in the Empire;<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> but they advanced slowly,
and it was between eight and nine o'clock in the evening before
they reached the gates of Augsburg.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> Here they met
the burgomaster and councillors, who prostrated themselves
before Charles, and at the same time the cannon from the
ramparts, the bells from all the steeples in full peal, the noise
of trumpets and kettle-drums, and the joyful acclamations of
the people re-echoed with loud din. Stadion, bishop of Augsburg,
and his clergy robed in white, struck up the <i>Advenisti
desirabilis</i>; and six canons, advancing with a magnificent canopy,
prepared to conduct the Emperor to the cathedral, when
Charles's horse, startled at this unusual sight, suddenly reared,<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>
so that the Emperor with difficulty mastered him. At length
Charles entered the basilick, which was ornamented
with garlands and flowers, and suddenly illuminated by a
thousand torches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BENEDICTION.</div>

<p>The Emperor went up to the altar, and falling on his
knees, raised his hands towards heaven.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> During the <i>Te
Deum</i>, the Protestants observed with anxiety that Charles
kept conversing in a low tone with the Archbishop of
Mentz; that he bent his ear to the legate who approached to
speak to him, and nodded in a friendly manner to Duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
George. All this appeared to them of evil omen; but at the
moment when the priests sang the <i>Te ergo quæsimus</i>, Charles,
breaking off his conversations, suddenly rose, and one of the
acolytes running to him with a gold-embroidered cushion, the
Emperor put it aside, and knelt on the bare stones of the
church. All the assembly knelt with him; the Elector and
the Landgrave alone remained standing. Duke George, astonished
at such boldness, threw a threatening glance at his
cousin. The Margrave of Brandenburg, carried away by the
crowd, had fallen on his knees; but having seen his two allies
standing, he hastily rose up again.</p>

<p>The Cardinal-archbishop of Salzburg then proceeded to
pronounce the benediction; but Campeggio, impatient at
having as yet taken no part in the ceremony, hastened to the
altar, and rudely thrusting the archbishop aside, said sharply
to him:<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> "this office belongs to me, and not to you." The
other gave way, the Emperor bent down, and the Landgrave,
with difficulty concealing a smile, hid himself behind a candelabrum.
The bells now rang out anew, the procession
recommenced its march, and the princes conducted the Emperor
to the Palatinate (the name given to the bishop's palace),
which had been prepared for him. The crowd now
dispersed: it was after ten at night.</p>

<p>The hour was come in which the partisans of the Papacy
flattered themselves with the prospect of rendering the Protestants
untrue to their faith. The arrival of the Emperor,
the procession of the holy sacrament that was preparing, the
late hour,&mdash;all had been calculated beforehand; "the nocturns
of treason were about to begin," said Spalatin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARLES AND THE LANDGRAVE.</div>

<p>A few minutes of general conversation took place in the
Emperor's apartments; the princes of the Romish party were
then allowed to retire; but Charles had given a sign to the
Elector of Saxony, to the Landgrave of Hesse, to George of
Brandenburg, to the Prince of Anhalt, and to the Duke of
Luneburg to follow him into his private chamber.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
brother Ferdinand, who was to serve as interpreter, alone
went in with them. Charles thought that so long as the
Protestant princes were observed, they would not yield; but
that in a private and friendly interview, he might obtain
all he desired of them.</p>

<p>"His majesty requests you to discontinue the preachings,"
said Ferdinand. On hearing these words the two old princes
(the Elector and the Margrave) turned pale and did not
speak;<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> there was a long silence.</p>

<p>At last the Landgrave said: "We entreat your majesty to
withdraw your request, for our ministers preach only the
pure Word of God, as did the ancient doctors of the Church,
St. Augustin, St. Hilary, and so many others. It will be easy
for your majesty to convince yourself of it. We cannot deprive
ourselves of the food of the Word of God, and deny his
Gospel."<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EMPEROR'S SILENCE.</div>

<p>Ferdinand, resuming the conversation in French<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> (for it
was in this language that he conversed with his brother), informed
the Emperor of the Landgrave's answer. Nothing
was more displeasing to Charles than these citations of Hilary
and Augustin; the colour mounted to his cheeks, and he
was nearly getting angry.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> "His Majesty," said Ferdinand
in a more positive tone, "cannot desist from his demand."&mdash;"Your
conscience," quickly replied the Landgrave, "has
no right to command ours."<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> As Ferdinand still persisted,
the Margrave, who had been silent until then, could contain
himself no longer; and without caring for interpreters,
stretched out his neck towards Charles, exclaiming in deep
emotion: "Rather than allow the Word of the Lord to be
taken from me, rather than deny my God, I would kneel before
your Majesty and have my head cut off!" As he uttered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
these simple and magnanimous words, says a contemporary,<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>
the prince accompanied them with a significant gesture,
and let his hands fall on his neck like the headsman's axe.
The excitement of the princes was at its height: had it been
necessary, they would all four have instantly walked to the
scaffold. Charles was moved by it: surprised and agitated,
he hastily cried out in his bad German, making a show of
checking the Landgrave: "Dear prince, not the head! not
the head!" But he had scarcely uttered these few words,
when he checked himself.</p>

<p>These were the only words that Charles pronounced before
the princes during all the diet. His ignorance of the German
language, and sometimes also the etiquette of the Escurial,
compelled him to speak only by the mouth of his
brother or of the Count-palatine. As he was in the habit
of consecrating four hours daily to divine worship, the people
said: "He talks more with God than with men." This habitual
silence was not favourable to his plans. They required
activity and eloquence; but instead of that the Germans
saw in the dumb countenance of their youthful Emperor, a
mere puppet, nodding his head and winking his eyes.
Charles sometimes felt very keenly the faults of this position:
"To be able to speak German," said he, "I would willingly
sacrifice any other language, even were it Spanish or French,
and more than that, one of my states."<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">FAILURE OF THE INTERVIEW.</div>

<p>Ferdinand saw that it was useless to insist on the cessation
of these meetings; but he had another arrow in his quiver.
The next day was the festival of <i>Corpus Christi</i>, and by a
custom that had never as yet been infringed, all the princes
and deputies present at the diet were expected to take part in
the procession. What! would the Protestants refuse this act
of courtesy at the very opening of a diet to which each one
came in a conciliatory spirit? Have they not declared that
the body and blood of Christ are really in the Host? Do they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
not boast of their opposition to Zwingle, and can they stand
aloof, without being tainted with heresy? Now, if they share
in the pomp that surrounds "the Lord's body;" if they mingle
with that crowd of clergy, glittering in luxury and swelling
with pride, who carry about the God whom they have
created; if they are present when the people bow down;
will they not irrevocably compromise their faith? The machine
is well prepared; its movements cannot fail; there
is no more doubt! The craft of the Italians is about to triumph
over the simplicity of these German boors!</p>

<p>Ferdinand therefore resumes, and making a weapon of the
very refusal that he has just met with: "Since the Emperor,"
said he, "cannot obtain from you the suspension of your
assemblies, he begs at least that you will accompany him
to-morrow, according to custom, in the procession of the
Holy Sacrament. Do so, if not from regard to him, at least
for the honour of Almighty God."<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p>The princes were still more irritated and alarmed.
"Christ," said they, "did not institute his sacrament to be
worshipped." Charles perseveres in his demand, and the
Protestants in their refusal.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> Upon this the Emperor declares
that he cannot accept their excuse, that he will give
them time for reflection, and that they must be prepared to
reply early on the morrow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AGITATION OF CHARLES.</div>

<p>They separated in the greatest agitation. The Prince-electoral,
who had waited for his father in the first hall
along with other lords, sought, at the moment the princes
issued from the Emperor's chamber, to read on their countenance
what had taken place. Judging from the emotion
depicted on their features that the struggle had been severe,
he thought that his father was incurring the greatest dangers,
and accordingly, grasping him by the hand, he dragged him
to the staircase of the palace, exclaiming in affright, as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Charles's satellites were already at his heels, "Come, come
quickly!"</p>

<p>Charles, who had expected no such resistance, was in truth
confounded, and the legate endeavoured to exasperate him still
more.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> Agitated, filled with anger and vexation, and uttering
the most terrible threats,<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> the young Emperor paced hastily
to and fro the halls of his palace; and unable to wait till
the morrow for the answer, he sent in the middle of the night
to demand the Elector's final decision. "At present we require
sleep," replied the latter; "to-morrow we will let you
know our determination."<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> As for the Landgrave, he could
not rest any more than Charles. Scarcely had he returned
home, when he sent his chancellor to the Nuremberg deputies,
and had them awoke to make them acquainted with what
had taken place.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>At the same time Charles's demand was laid before the
theologians, and Spalatin, taking the pen, drew up their opinion
during the night. "The sacrament," it bore, "was not
instituted to be worshipped, as the Jews worshipped the brazen
image.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> We are here to confess the truth, and not for
the confirmation of abuses. Let us therefore stay away!"
This opinion strengthened the Evangelical princes in their
determination; and the day of the 16th June began.</p>

<p>The Elector of Saxony feeling indisposed during the night,
commissioned his son to represent him; and at seven o'clock
the princes and councillors repaired on horseback to the Emperor's
palace.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PROCESSION OF CORPUS CHRISTI.</div>

<p>The Margrave of Brandenburg was their spokesman.
"You know," said he to Charles, "how, at the risk of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
lives, my ancestors and myself have supported your august
house. But, in the things of God, the commands of God
himself oblige me to put aside all commandment of man.
We are told that death awaits those who shall persevere in
the sound doctrine: I am ready to suffer it." He then presented
the declaration of the Evangelical princes to the
Emperor. "We will not countenance by our presence," said
they, "these impious human traditions, which are opposed to
the Word of God. We declare, on the contrary, without
hesitation, and with one accord, that we must expel them
from the Church, lest those of its members that are still
sound should be infected by this deadly poison."<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> "If you
will not accompany his majesty for the love of God," said
Ferdinand, "do so at least for love of the Emperor, and as
vassals of the Empire.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> His majesty commands you." "An
act of worship is in question," replied the princes, "our conscience
forbids it." Then Ferdinand and Charles having conversed
together in a low tone: "His majesty desires to see,"
said the king, "whether you will obey him or not."<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> At
the same time the Emperor and his brother quitted the room;
but the princes, instead of following him, as Charles had
hoped, returned full of joy to their palaces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXASPERATION OF CHARLES.</div>

<p>The procession did not begin till noon. Immediately behind
the canopy under which the Elector of Mentz carried
the Host, came the Emperor alone, with a devout air, bearing
a taper in his hand, his head bare and shorn like a priest's,
although the noon-day sun darted on him its most ardent
rays.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> By exposing himself to these fatigues, Charles desired
to profess aloud his faith in what constitutes the essence of
Roman-catholicism. In proportion as the spirit and the life
had escaped from the primitive Churches, they had striven to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
replace them by forms, shows, and ceremonies. The essential
cause of the Romish worship is found in that decline of charity
and faith which catholic Christians of the first ages have
often deplored; and the history of Rome is summed up in
this expression of St. Paul, <i>Having a form of godliness, but denying
the power thereof</i>.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> But as the power was then beginning
to revive in the Church, the form began also to decline.
Barely a hundred citizens of Augsburg had joined in the procession
of the 16th June. It was no longer the pomp of former
times: the christian people had learned anew to love and
to believe.</p>

<p>Charles, however, under an air of devotion concealed a
wounded heart. The legate was less able to command himself,
and said aloud that this obstinacy of the princes would
be the cause of great mischief to the Pope.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> When the
procession was over (it had lasted an hour), Charles could no
longer master his extreme irritation; and he had scarcely
returned to his palace, when he declared that he would give
the Protestant princes a safe-conduct, and that on the very
next day these obstinate and rebellious men should quit
Augsburg;<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> the diet would then take such resolutions as
were required for the safety of the Church and of the Empire.
It was no doubt the legate who had given Charles this idea,
whose execution would infallibly have led to a religious war.
But some of the princes of the Roman party, desirous of preserving
peace, succeeded, though not without difficulty, in
getting the Emperor to withdraw his threatening order.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SERMONS PROHIBITED.</div>

<p>V. Charles, being defeated on the subject of the procession,
resolved to take his revenge on the assemblies, for nothing
galled him like these sermons. The crowd ceased not to
fill the vast church of the Franciscans, where a Zwinglian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
minister of lively and penetrating eloquence was preaching
on the Book of Joshua.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> He placed the kings of Canaan
and the children of Israel before them: his congregation
heard them speak and saw them act, and every one recognized
in Canaan the Emperor and the Ultra-montane princes,
and in the people of God the adherents of the Reformation.
In consequence, the faithful quitted the church enthusiastic
in their faith, and filled with the desire of seeing the abominations
of the idolaters fall to the ground. On the 16th June,
the Protestants deliberated on Charles's demand, and it was
rejected by the majority. "It is only a scarecrow," said
they; "the Papists only desire to see if the nail shakes in the
wall, and if they can start the hare from the thicket."</p>

<p>The next morning (17th June) before breakfast, the princes
replied to the Emperor. "To forbid our ministers to preach
purely the holy Gospel would be rebellion against God, who
wills that his Word be not bound. Poor sinners that we are,
we have need of this Divine Word to surmount our troubles.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>
Moreover, his majesty has declared, that in this diet each doctrine
should be examined with impartiality. Now, to order
us henceforward to suspend the sermons, would be to condemn
ours beforehand."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A COMPROMISE PROPOSED.</div>

<p>Charles immediately convoked the other temporal and
spiritual princes, who arrived at mid-day at the Palatine palace,
and remained sitting until the evening;<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> the discussion
was exceedingly animated. "This very morning," said some
of the speakers, "the Protestant princes, as they quitted the
Emperor, had sermons delivered in public."<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> Exasperated
at this new affront, Charles with difficulty contained himself.
Some of the princes, however, having entreated him to accept
their mediation, he consented to it; but the Protestants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
were immovable. Did these heretics, whom they imagined
to reduce so easily, appear in Augsburg only to humiliate
Charles? The honour of the chief of the Empire must be
saved at any cost. "Let us ourselves renounce our preachers,"
said the princes; "the Protestants will not then persist
in keeping theirs!"</p>

<p>The commission proposed accordingly that the Emperor
should set aside both Papist and Lutheran preachers, and
should nominate a few chaplains, with authority to announce
the pure Word of God, without attacking either of the two
parties.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> "They shall be neutral men," said they to the Protestants;
"neither Faber nor his partisans shall be admitted."&mdash;"But
they will condemn our doctrine."&mdash;"By no means.
The preacher shall do nothing but read the text of the Gospels,
Epistles, and a general confession of sins."<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> The evangelical
states required time to reflect upon it.</p>

<p>"We must accept it," said Melancthon; "for if our obstinacy
should lead the Emperor to refuse hearing our confession,
the evil would be greater still."</p>

<p>"We are called to Augsburg," said Agricola, "to give
an account of our doctrine, and not to preach."<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></p>

<p>"There is no little disorder in the city," remarked Spalatin.
"The Sacramentarians and Enthusiasts preach here as well
as we: we must get out of this confusion."</p>

<p>"What do the Papists propose?" said other theologians;
"to read the Gospels and Epistles without explanation. But
is not that a victory? What! we protest against the interpretations
of the Church; and lo! priests who are to read the
Word of God without their notes and commentaries, that is to
say, transforming themselves into Protestant ministers!" "O!
admirable wisdom of the courtiers!" exclaimed Melancthon,
smiling.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">CURIOSITY OF THE CITIZENS.</div>

<p>To these motives were added the opinions of the lawyers.
As the Emperor ought to be considered the rightful magistrate
of an imperial city, so long as he made it his residence,
all jurisdiction in Augsburg really belonged to him.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the Protestant princes, "we agree to silence
our preachers, in the hope that we shall hear nothing
offensive to our consciences. If it were otherwise, we should
feel ourselves constrained to repel so serious an insult.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> Besides,"
added the Elector, as he withdrew, "we hope that if
at anytime we desire to hear one of our chaplains in our
own palace, we shall be free to do so."<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p>They hastened to the Emperor, who desired nothing better
than to come to an understanding with the Protestants on this
subject, and who ratified everything.</p>

<p>This was Saturday. An imperial herald was immediately
sent out, who, parading the streets of the city at seven in the
evening to the sound of trumpets,<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> cried with all his might:
"O yes, O yes!<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> Thus ordains his imperial majesty, our
most gracious lord: no preacher whatever shall preach in
Augsburg except such as his majesty shall have nominated;
and that under penalty of incurring the displeasure and punishment
of his majesty."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The New Preachers.</div>

<p>A thousand different remarks were exchanged in the houses
of the citizens of Augsburg. "We are very impatient," said
they, "to see the preachers appointed by the Emperor, and
who will preach (O! unprecedented wonder!) neither against
the evangelical doctrine nor against the doctrine of the Pope!"<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>
"We must expect," added another, "to behold some Tragelaph
or some chimera with the head of a lion, a goat's body,
and a dragon's tail."<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> The Spaniards appeared well satisfied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
with this agreement, for many of them had never heard a single
sermon in their lives; it was not the custom in Spain;
but Zwingle's friends were filled with indignation and alarm.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>At length Sunday the 19th of June began; every one hastened
to the churches, and the faithful who filled them, with
eyes fixed on the priest and with attentive ears,<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> prepared
to listen to what these new and strange preachers would
say.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> It was generally believed that their task would be to
make an evangelico-papistical discourse, and they were very
impatient to hear this marvel. But</p>

<p class="center">
"The mountain in labour, gave birth to a mouse!"<br />
</p>

<p>The preacher first read the commonprayer; he then added
the Gospel of the day, finished with a general confession of
sins, and dismissed his congregation. People looked at one
another in surprise: "Verily," said they, "here is a preacher
that is neither Gospeller nor Papist, but strictly textual."<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> At
last all burst into laughter; "and truly," adds Brenz, "there
was reason enough."<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> In some churches, however, the chaplains,
after reading the Gospel, added a few puerile words
void of Christianity and of consolation, and in no way founded
on the holy Scripture.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MEDLEY OF POPERY.</div>

<p>After the so-called sermon, they proceeded to the Mass.
That in the Cathedral was particularly noisy. The Emperor
was not present, for he was accustomed to sleep until nine
or ten o'clock,<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> and a late Mass was performed for him; but
Ferdinand and many of the princes were present. The pealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
notes of the organ, the resounding voices of the choir&mdash;all
were set to work, and a numerous and motley crowd, rushing
in at all the doors, filled the aisles of the temple. One
might have said that every nation in the world had agreed to
meet in the cathedral of Augsburg. Here were Frenchmen,
there Spaniards, Moors in one place, Moriscos in another, on
one side Italians, on the other Turks, and even, says Brenz,
those who are called Stratiots.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> This crowd was no bad representation
of the medley of Popery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER ENCOURAGES THE PRINCES.</div>

<p>One priest alone, a fervent Romanist, dared to offer an apology
for the Mass in the Church of the Holy Cross. Charles,
wishing to maintain his authority, had him thrown into the
Grey Friars' prison, whence they contrived to let him escape.
As for the Evangelical pastors of Augsburg, almost all left
the city to bear the Gospel elsewhere. The Protestant
princes were anxious to secure for their churches the assistance
of such distinguished men. Discouragement and alarm
followed close upon this step, and even the firmest were moved.
The Elector was inconsolable at the privation imposed
upon him by the Emperor. "Our Lord God," said he,
heaving a deep sigh, "has received an order to be silent at
the Diet of Augsburg."<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> From that time forward Luther
lost the good opinion he had previously entertained of
Charles, and foreboded the stormiest future. "See what will
be the end of all this," said he. "The Emperor, who has
ordered the Elector to renounce the assemblies, will afterwards
command him to renounce the doctrine; the diet will
enter upon its paroxysm, and nothing will remain for us but
to rely upon the arm of the Lord." Then giving way to all
his indignation, he added: "The Papists, abandoned to devils,
are transported with rage; and to live, they must drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
blood.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> They wish to give themselves an air of justice, by
giving us one of obstinacy. It is not with men that you
have to deal at Augsburg, but with the very gates of hell."
Melancthon himself saw all his hopes vanish. "All, except
the Emperor," said he, "hate us with the most violent hatred.
The danger is great, very great.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>......Pray to Christ that
he may save us!" But Luther, however full of sorrow he
might be, far from being cast down, raised his head and endeavoured
to reanimate the courage of his brethren. "Be
assured and doubt not," wrote he to them, "that you are the
confessors of Jesus Christ, and the ambassadors of the Great
King."<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>They had need of these thoughts, for their adversaries, elated
by this first success, neglected nothing that might destroy
the Protestants, and taking another step forward, proposed
forcing them to be present at the Romish ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>
"The Elector of Saxony," said the legate to Charles, "ought
in virtue of his office of Grand-marshal of the Empire to
carry the sword before you in all the ceremonies of the diet.
Order him therefore to perform his duty at the Mass of the
Holy Ghost, which is to open the sittings." The Emperor
did so immediately, and the Elector, uneasy at this message,
called together his theologians. If he refused, his dignity
would be taken away; and if he obeyed, he would trample
his faith under foot, thought he, and would do dishonour to
the Gospel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MASS OF THE HOLY GHOST.</div>

<p>But the Lutheran Divines removed the scruples of their
prince. "It is for a ceremony of the Empire," said they,
"as Grand-Marshal, and not as a Christian, that you are summoned;
the Word of God itself, in the history of Naaman,
authorizes you to comply with this invitation."<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> The friends
of Zwingle did not think so; their walk was more decided
than that of Wittemberg. "The martyrs allowed themselves
to be put to death," said they, "rather than burn a grain of
incense before the idols." Even some of the Protestants hearing
that the <i>Veni Spiritus</i> was to be sung, said, wagging their
heads: "We are very much afraid that the chariot of the
Spirit, which is the Word of God, having been taken away
by the Papists, the Holy Ghost, despite their Mass, will
never reach Augsburg."<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> Neither these fears nor these objections
were listened to.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">THE SERMON.</div>

<p>On Monday the 20th June, the Emperor and his brother,
with the electors and princes of the Empire, having entered
the cathedral, took their seats on the right side of the choir;
on the left were placed the legate, the archbishops, and bishops;
in the middle were the ambassadors. Without the
choir, in a gallery that overlooked it, were ranged the Landgrave
and other Protestants, who preferred being at a distance
from the Host.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> The Elector, bearing the sword, remained
upright near the altar at the moment of the adoration.
The acolytes, having closed the gates of the choir immediately
after,<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> Vincent Pompinello, archbishop of Salerno, preached
the sermon. He commenced with the Turks and their ravages,
and then, by an unexpected turn, began suddenly to exalt
the Turks even above the Germans. "The Turks," said he,
"have but one prince whom they obey; but the Germans
have many who obey no one. The Turks live under one
sole law, one only custom, one only religion; but among the
Germans, there are some who are always wishing for new
laws, new customs, new religions. They tear the seamless
coat of Christ; they abolish by devilish inspirations the sacred
doctrines established by unanimous consent, and substitute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
for them, alas! buffoonery and obscenity.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> Magnanimous
Emperor, powerful King!" said he, turning towards
Charles and his brother, "sharpen your swords, wield them
against these perfidious disturbers of religion, and thus bring
them back into the fold of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> There is no peace
for Germany so long as the sword shall not have entirely
eradicated this heresy.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> O St. Peter and St. Paul! I call
upon you; upon you, St. Peter, in order that you may open
the stony hearts of these princes with your keys; and upon
you, St. Paul, that if they show themselves too rebellious,
you may come with your sword, and cut in pieces this unexampled
hardness!"</p>

<p>This discourse, intermingled with panegyrics of Aristides,
Themistocles, Scipio, Cato, the Curtii and Scævola, being concluded,
the Emperor and princes arose to make their offerings.
Pappenheim returned the sword to the Elector, who had intrusted
it to him; and the Grand-marshal, as well as the
Margrave, went to the offertory, but with a smile, as it is reported.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>
This fact is but little in harmony with the character
of these princes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OPENING OF THE DIET.</div>

<p>At length they quitted the cathedral. No one, except the
friends of the nuncio, was pleased with the sermon. Even
the Archbishop of Mentz was offended at it. "What does
he mean," exclaimed he, "by calling on St. Paul to cut the
Germans with his sword?" Nothing but a few inarticulate
sounds had been heard in the nave; the Protestants eagerly
questioned those of their party who had been present in the
choir. "The more these priests inflame people's minds, and
the more they urge their princes to bloody wars," said Brenz
at that time, "the more we must hinder ours from giving way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
to violence."<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> Thus spoke a minister of the Gospel of peace
after the sermon of the priest of Rome.</p>

<p>After the mass of the Holy Ghost, the Emperor entered his
carriage,<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> and having reached the town-hall, where the sittings
of the diet were to take place, he took his seat on a
throne covered with cloth of gold, while his brother placed
himself on a bench in front of him; then all around them
were ranged the Electors, forty-two sovereign princes, the
deputies from the cities, the bishops, and ambassadors, forming,
indeed, that illustrious assembly which Luther, six weeks
before, had imagined he saw sitting in the air.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>

<p>The Count-palatine read the imperial proposition. It referred
to two points; the war against the Turks, and the
religious controversy. "Sacrificing my private injuries and
interests to the common good," said the Emperor, "I have
quitted my hereditary kingdoms to pass, not without great
danger, into Italy, and from thence to Germany. I have
heard with sorrow of the divisions that have broken out here,
and which, striking not only at the imperial majesty, but still
more, at the commandments of Almighty God, must engender
pillage, conflagration, war, and death."<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> At one o'clock the
Emperor, accompanied by all the princes, returned to his palace.</p>

<p>On the same day the Elector gathered around him all his
co-religionists, whom the Emperor's speech had greatly excited,
and exhorted them not to be turned aside by any threats
from a cause which was that of God himself.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> All seemed

<p>The Elector had a heavy burden to bear. Not only had
he to walk at the head of the princes, but he had further to
defend himself against the enervating influence of Melancthon.
It is not an abstraction of the state which this prince
presents to our notice throughout the whole of this affair:
it is the most noble individuality. Early on Tuesday morning,
feeling the necessity of that invisible strength which, according
to a beautiful figure in the holy Scriptures, causes us
to ride upon the high places of the earth; and seeing, as was
usual, his domestics, his councillors, and his son assembled
around him, John begged them affectionately to withdraw.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>
He knew that it was only by kneeling humbly before God
that he could stand with courage before Charles. Alone in
his chamber, he opened and read the Psalms, then falling
on his knees, he offered up the most fervent prayer to God;<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>
next, wishing to confirm himself in the immovable fidelity
that he had just vowed to the Lord, he went to his desk, and
there committed his resolutions to writing. Dolzig and Melancthon
afterwards saw these lines, and were filled with admiration
as they read them.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<p>Being thus tempered anew in heavenly thoughts, John
took up the imperial proposition, and meditated over it; then,
having called in his son and the chancellor Bruck, and Melancthon
shortly after, they all agreed that the deliberations
of the diet ought to commence with the affairs of religion;
and his allies, who were consulted, concurred in this advice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VALDEZ AND MELANCTHON.</div>

<p>The legate had conceived a plan diametrically opposed to
this. He desired to stifle the religious question, and for this
end required that the princes should examine it in a secret
committee.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> The Evangelical Christians entertained no
doubt that if the truth was proclaimed in the great council of
the nation, it would gain the victory; but the more they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
desired a public confession, the more it was dreaded by the
Pope's friends. The latter wished to take their adversaries
by silence, without confession, without discussion, as a city is
taken by famine without fighting and without a storm: to
gag the Reformation, and thus reduce it to powerlessness and
death, were their tactics. To have silenced the preachers was
not enough: the princes must be silenced also. They wished
to shut up the Reformation as in a dungeon, and there leave
it to die, thinking they would thus get rid of it more surely
than by leading it to the scaffold.</p>

<p>This plan was well conceived: it now remained to be put
in execution, and for that purpose it was necessary to persuade
the Protestants that such a method would be the surest for
them. The person selected for this intrigue was Alphonso
Valdez, secretary to Charles V., a Spanish gentleman, a worthy
individual, and who afterwards showed a leaning towards
the Reformation. Policy often makes use of good men for
the most perfidious designs. It was decided that Valdez should
address the most timid of the Protestants&mdash;Melancthon.</p>

<p>On the 16th or 17th of June, immediately after the arrival
of Charles, Valdez begged Melancthon to call on him. "The
Spaniards," said he, "imagine that the Lutherans teach impious
doctrines on the Holy Trinity, on Jesus Christ, on the
blessed Mother of God.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> Accordingly, they think they do a
more meritorious work in killing a Lutheran than in slaying
a Turk."</p>

<p>"I know it," replied Melancthon, "and I have not yet been
able to succeed in making your fellow-countrymen abandon
that idea."</p>

<p>"But what, pray, do the Lutherans desire?"</p>

<p>"The Lutheran question is not so complicated and so unseemly
as his majesty fancies. We do not attack the Catholic
Church, as is commonly believed;<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> and the whole controversy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
is reducible to these three points. The two kinds in
the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, the marriage of pastors,
and the abolition of private masses. If we could agree on
these articles, it would be easy to come to an understanding
on the others."</p>

<p>"Well, I will report this to his majesty."</p>

<p>Charles V. was charmed at this communication. "Go,"
said he to Valdez, "and impart these things to the legate,
and ask Master Philip to transmit to you in writing a short
exposition of what they believe and what they deny."</p>

<p>Valdez hastened to Campeggio. "What you relate pleases
me tolerably," said the latter. "As for the two kinds in the
sacrament, and the marriage of priests, there will be means of
accommodation;<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> but we cannot consent to the abolition of
private masses." This would have been in fact cutting off
one of the greatest revenues of the Church.</p>

<p>On Saturday, June 18, Valdez saw Melancthon again.
"The Emperor begs of you a moderate and concise exposition,"
said he, "and he is persuaded that it will be more advantageous
to treat of this matter briefly and privately,<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>
avoiding all public hearing and all prolix discussion, which
would only engender anger and division."&mdash;"Well," said Melancthon,
"I will reflect upon it."</p>

<p>Melancthon was almost won over: a secret conference
agreed better with his disposition. Had he not often repeated
that peace should be sought after above all things? Thus
everything induced the legate to hope that a public struggle
would be avoided, and that he might be content, as it were, to
send mutes against the Reform, and strangle it in a dungeon.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">EVANGELICAL FIRMNESS PREVAILS.</div>

<p>Fortunately the Chancellor and the Elector Frederick did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
not think fit to entertain the propositions with which Charles
had commissioned the worthy Valdez. The resolution of these
lay members of the Church saved it from the false step its
doctors were about to take; and the wiles of the Italians failed
against Evangelical firmness. Melancthon was only permitted
to lay the Confession before the Spaniard, that he might
look into it, and in despite of the moderation employed in it,
Valdez exclaimed: "These words are too bitter, and your
adversaries will never put up with them!"<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> Thus finished
the legate's man&oelig;uvre.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>VI. Charles, compelled to resign himself to a public sitting,
ordered on Wednesday, 22d June, that the Elector and his
allies should have their Confession ready for the ensuing Friday.
The Roman party were also invited to present a confession
of faith; but they excused themselves, saying that they
were satisfied with the Edict of Worms.</p>

<p>The Emperor's order took the Protestants by surprise, for
the negotiations between Valdez and Melancthon had prevented
the latter from putting the finishing stroke to the Confession.
It was not copied out fair; and the conclusions, as
well as the exordium, were not definitively drawn up. In consequence
of this, the Protestants begged the Archbishop of
Mentz to obtain for them the delay of a day; but their petition
was refused.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> They therefore laboured incessantly, even during
the night, to correct and transcribe the Confession.</p>

<p>On Thursday, 23d June, all the Protestant princes, deputies,
councillors, and theologians met early at the Elector's. The
Confession was read in German, and all gave their adhesion
to it, except the Landgrave and the Strasburgers, who required
a change in the article on the sacrament.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> The princes rejected
their demand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">THE SIGNING OF THE CONFESSION.</div>

<p>The Elector of Saxony was already preparing to sign,
when Melancthon stopped him: he feared giving too political
a colouring to this religious business. In his idea it was
the Church that should appear, and not the State. "It is for
the theologians and ministers to propose these things," said
he;<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> "let us reserve for other matters the authority of the
mighty ones of the earth."&mdash;"God forbid that you should exclude
me," replied the Elector; "I am resolved to do what is
right without troubling myself about my crown. I desire to
confess the Lord. My electoral hat and my ermine are not so
precious to me as the cross of Jesus Christ. I shall leave on
earth these marks of my greatness; but my Master's cross will
accompany me to heaven."</p>

<p>How resist such Christian language! Melancthon gave
way.</p>

<p>The Elector then approached, signed, and handed the pen
to the Landgrave, who at first made some objections; however
the enemy was at the door; was this the time for disunion?
At last he signed, but with a declaration that the
doctrine of the Eucharist did not please him.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">COURAGE OF THE PRINCES.</div>

<p>The Margrave and Luneburg having joyfully subscribed
their names, Anhalt took the pen in his turn, and said, "I
have tilted more than once to please others; now, if the honour
of my Lord Jesus Christ requires it, I am ready to saddle
my horse, to leave my goods and my life behind, and to rush
into eternity, towards an everlasting crown." Then, having
signed, this youthful prince said, turning to the theologians:
"Rather renounce my subjects and my states, rather quit the
country of my fathers staff in hand, rather gain my bread by
cleaning the shoes of the foreigner, than receive any other doctrine
than that which is contained in this Confession." Nuremberg
and Reutlingen alone of the cities subscribed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
signatures;<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> and all resolved on demanding of the Emperor
that the Confession should be read publicly.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>

<p>The courage of the princes surprised every one. Rome
had crushed the members of the Church, and had reduced
them to a herd of slaves, whom she dragged silent and humiliated
behind her: the Reformation enfranchised them, and
with their rights it restored to them their duties. The priest
no longer enjoyed the monopoly of religion; each head of
a family again became priest in his own house, and all the
members of the Church of God were thenceforward called to
the rank of confessors. The laymen are nothing, or almost
nothing, in the sect of Rome, but they are the essential portion
of the Church of Jesus Christ. Wherever the priestly
spirit is established, the Church dies; wherever laymen, as
these Augsburg princes, understand their duty and their immediate
dependence on Christ, the Church lives.</p>

<p>The Evangelical theologians were moved, by the devotedness
of the princes. "When I consider their firmness in the
confession of the Gospel," said Brenz, "the colour mounts to
my cheeks. What a disgrace that we, who are only beggars
beside them, are so afraid of confessing Christ!"<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> Brenz
was then thinking of certain towns, particularly of Halle, of
which he was pastor, but no doubt also of the theologians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MELANCTHON'S WEAKNESS.</div>

<p>The latter, in truth, without being deficient in devotedness,
were sometimes wanting in courage. Melancthon was in
constant agitation; he ran to and fro, slipping in everywhere
(says Cochl[eo]us in his Philippics), penetrating not only the
houses and mansions of private persons, but also insinuating
himself into the palaces of cardinals and princes, nay, even
into the court of the Emperor; and, whether at table or in
conversation, he spared no means of persuading every person,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
that nothing was more easy than to restore peace between
the two parties.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p>One day he was with the Archbishop of Salzburg, who in
a long discourse gave an eloquent description of the troubles
produced, as he said, by the Reformation, and ended with a
peroration "written in blood," says Melancthon.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> Philip in
agony had ventured during the conversation to slip in the
word Conscience. "Conscience!" hastily interrupted the
archbishop, "Conscience!&mdash;What does that mean? I tell
you plainly that the Emperor will not allow confusion to be
thus brought upon the Empire."&mdash;"Had I been in Melancthon's
place," said Luther, "I should have immediately replied
to the archbishop: And our Emperor, ours, will not tolerate
such blasphemy."&mdash;"Alas!" said Melancthon, "they are
all as full of assurance as if there was no God."<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<p>Another day Melancthon was with Campeggio, and conjured
him to persevere in the moderate sentiments he appeared
to entertain. And at another time, as it would seem,
he was with the Emperor himself.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> "Alas!" said the alarmed
Zwinglians, "after having qualified one half of the Gospel,
Melancthon is sacrificing the other."<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CONFESSION IN DANGER.</div>

<p>The wiles of the Ultramontanists were added to Philip's
dejection, in order to arrest the courageous proceedings of the
princes. Friday, 24th June, was the day fixed for reading the
Confession, but measures were taken to prevent it. The sitting
of the diet did not begin till three in the afternoon; the
legate was then announced; Charles went to meet him as
far as the top of the grand staircase, and Campeggio, taking
his seat in front of the Emperor, in King Ferdinand's place,
delivered a harangue in Ciceronian style. "Never," said he,
"has St. Peter's bark been so violently tossed by so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
waves, whirlwinds, and abysses.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> The Holy Father has
learnt these things with pain, and desires to drag the Church
from these frightful gulfs. For the love of Jesus Christ, for
the safety of your country and for your own, O mighty
Prince! get rid of these errors, deliver Germany, and save
Christendom!"</p>

<p>After a temperate reply from Albert of Mentz, the legate
quitted the townhall, and the Evangelical princes stood up;
but a fresh obstacle had been provided. Deputies from Austria,
Carinthia, and Carniola, first received a hearing.<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a></p>

<p>Much time had thus elapsed. The Evangelical princes,
however, rose up again, and the Chancellor Bruck said: "It
is pretended that new doctrines not based on Scripture, that
heresies and schisms are spread among the people by us.
Considering that such accusations compromise not only our
good name, but also the safety of our souls,<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> we beg his
majesty would have the goodness to hear what are the doctrines
we profess."</p>

<p>The Emperor, no doubt by arrangement with the legate,
made reply that it was too late; besides, that this reading
would be useless; and that the princes should be satisfied
with putting in their Confession in writing. Thus the mine,
so skilfully prepared, worked admirably; the Confession, once
handed to the Emperor, would be thrown aside, and the
Reformation would be forced to retire, without the Papists
having even condescended to hear it, without defence and
overwhelmed with contumely.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PROTESTANTS ARE FIRM.</div>

<p>The Protestant princes, uneasy, and agitated, insisted.
"Our honour is at stake," said they; "our souls are endangered.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>
We are accused publicly; publicly we ought to answer."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Charles was shaken; Ferdinand leant towards him,
and whispered a few words in his ear:<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> the Emperor refused
a second time.</p>

<p>Upon this the Elector and princes, in still greater alarm,
said for the third time with emotion and earnestness:<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> "For
the love of God, let us read our Confession! No person
is insulted in it." Thus were seen, on the one hand, a few
faithful men, desiring with loud cries to confess their faith;
and on the other, the great Emperor of the West, surrounded
by a crowd of cardinals, prelates, and princes, endeavouring
to stifle the manifestation of the truth.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> It was a serious,
violent, and decisive struggle, in which the holiest interests
were discussed!</p>

<p>At last Charles appeared to yield: "His majesty grants
your request," was the reply to the princes; "but as it is
now too late, he begs you to transmit him your written Confession,
and to-morrow, at two o'clock, the diet will be prepared
to hear it read at the Palatine Palace."</p>

<p>The princes were struck with these words, which, seeming
to grant them everything, in reality granted nothing. In the
first place, it was not in a public sitting at the town-hall, but
privately in his own palace, that the Emperor was willing
to hear them;<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> then they had no doubt that if the Confession
left their hands it was all over with the public reading.
They therefore remained firm. "The work has been done
in great haste," said they, and it was the truth; "pray leave
it with us to-night, that we may revise it." The Emperor
was obliged to yield, and the Protestants returned to their
hotels full of joy; while the legate and his friends, perceiving
that the Confession was inevitable, saw the morrow approach
with anxiety continually increasing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">MELANCTHON'S DESPONDENCE.</div>

<p>Among those who prepared to confess the Evangelical
truth, was one, however, whose heart was filled with sadness:&mdash;it
was Melancthon. Placed between two fires, he saw the
Reformed, and many even of his own friends, reproach his
weakness; while the opposite party detested what they called
his hypocrisy. His friend Camerarius, who visited Augsburg
about this time, often found him plunged in thought, uttering
deep sighs, and shedding bitter tears.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> Brenz, moved with
compassion, coming to the unhappy Philip, would sit down
by his side and weep with him;<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> and Jonas, endeavouring to
console him in another manner, exhorted him to take the
Book of Psalms, and cry to God with all his heart, making
use of David's words rather than of his own.</p>

<p>One day intelligence arrived which formed a general topic
of conversation in Augsburg, and which, spreading terror
among the partisans of the Pope, gave a momentary relief to
Melancthon. It was said that a mule in Rome had given
birth to a colt with crane's feet. "This prodigy," said Melancthon
thoughtfully, "announces that Rome is near its
end;"<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> perhaps because the crane is a bird of passage, and
that the Pope's mule thus gave signs of departure. Melancthon
had immediately written to Luther, who replied that he
was exceedingly rejoiced that God had given the Pope so
striking a sign of his approaching fall.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> It is good to call to
memory these puerilities of the age of the Reformers, that
we may better understand the high range of these men of
God in matters of faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S PRAYER.</div>

<p>These idle Roman stories did not long console Melancthon.
On the eve of the 25th June, he was present in imagination
at the reading of that Confession which he had drawn up,
which was about to be proclaimed before the world, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
which one word too many or too few might decide on the
approbation or the hatred of the princes, on the safety or
ruin of the Reformation and of the Empire. He could bear
up no longer, and the feeble Atlas, crushed under the burden
of the world upon his shoulders, gave utterance to a
cry of anguish. "All my time here is spent in tears and
mourning," wrote he to Vitus Diedrich, Luther's secretary
in the castle of Coburg;<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> and on the morrow he wrote to
Luther himself: "My dwelling is in perpetual tears.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> My
consternation is indescribable.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> O my father! I do not wish
my words to exaggerate my sorrows; but, without your consolations,
it is impossible for me to enjoy here the least
peace."</p>

<p>Nothing in fact presented so strong a contrast to the distrust
and desolations of Melancthon, as the faith, calmness, and
exultation of Luther. It was of advantage to him that
he was not then in the midst of the Augsburg vortex, and to
be able from his stronghold to set his foot with tranquillity
upon the rock of God's promises. He was sensible himself
of the value of this peaceful hermitage, as he called it.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> "I
cannot sufficiently admire," said Vitus Diedrich, "the firmness,
cheerfulness, and faith of this man, so astonishing
in such cruel times."</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S ANXIETY.</div>

<p>Luther, besides his constant reading of the Word of God,<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>
did not pass a day without devoting three hours at least
to prayer, and they were hours selected from those the
most favourable to study.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> One day, as Diedrich approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the Reformer's chamber, he heard his voice,<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> and remained
motionless, holding his breath, a few steps from the
door. Luther was praying, and his prayer (said the secretary)
was full of adoration, fear, and hope, as when one speaks
to a friend or to a father.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> "I know that thou art our Father
and our God," said the Reformer, alone in his chamber, "and
that thou wilt scatter the persecutors of thy children, for
thou art thyself endangered with us. All this matter is
thine, and it is only by thy constraint that we have put our
hands to it. Defend us then, O Father!" The secretary, motionless
as a statue, in the long gallery of the castle, lost not
one of the words that the clear and resounding voice of Luther
bore to his ears.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> The Reformer was earnest with God,
and called upon him with so much unction to accomplish his
promises, that Diedrich felt his heart glow within him.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>
"Oh!" exclaimed he, as he retired, "How could not these
prayers but prevail in the desperate struggle at Augsburg!"</p>

<p>Luther might also have allowed himself to be overcome
with fear, for he was left in complete ignorance of what was
taking place in the diet. A Wittemberg messenger, who
should have brought him forests of letters (according to his
own expression), having presented himself: "Do you bring
any letters?" asked Luther. "No!" "How are those gentlemen?"
"Well!" Luther, grieved at such silence, returned
and shut himself up in his chamber.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S TEXTS.</div>

<p>Erelong there appeared a courier on horseback carrying
despatches from the Elector to Torgau. "Do you bring me
any letters?" asked Luther. "No!" "How are those gentlemen?"
continued he, fearfully. "Well!" "This is strange,"
thought the Reformer. A waggon having left Coburg laden
with flour (for they were almost in want of provisions at
Augsburg), Luther impatiently awaited the return of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
waggoner; but he returned empty. Luther then began to
revolve the gloomiest thoughts in his mind, not doubting that
they were concealing some misfortune from him.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> At last
another individual, Jobst Nymptzen, having arrived from
Augsburg, Luther rushed anew towards him, with his usual
question. "Do you bring me any letters?" He waited
trembling for the reply. "No!" "And how then are those
gentlemen?" "Well!" The Reformer withdrew, a prey to
anger and to fear.</p>

<p>Then Luther opened his Bible, and to console himself for
the silence of men, he conversed with God. There were
some passages of Scripture in particular that he read continually.
We point them out below.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> He did more; he wrote
with his own hand many declarations of Scripture over the
doors and windows, and on the walls of the castle. In one
place were these words from the 118th Psalm: <i>I shall not die,
but live, and declare the works of the Lord</i>. In another, those
of the 12th chapter of Proverbs: <i>The way of the wicked seduceth
them</i>; and over his bed, these words from the 4th
Psalm: <i>I will both lay me down in peace and sleep; for thou, O
Lord, only makest me dwell in safety</i>. Never perhaps did man
so environ himself with the promises of the Lord, or so dwell
in the atmosphere of his Word and live by his breath, as
Luther at Coburg.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER TO MELANCTHON.</div>

<p>At length letters came. "If the times in which we live
were not opposed to it, I should have imagined some revenge,"
wrote Luther to Jonas; "but prayer checked my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
anger, and anger checked my prayer.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> I am delighted at
that tranquil mind which God gives our prince. As for
Melancthon, it is his philosophy that tortures him, and nothing
else. For our cause is in the very hands of Him who
can say with unutterable pride: <i>No one shall pluck it out of
my hands</i>. I would not have it in our hands, and it would
not be desirable that it were so.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> I have had many things
in my hands, and I have lost them all; but whatever I have
been able to place in God's, I still possess."</p>

<p>On learning that Melancthon's anguish still continued,
Luther wrote to him: and these are words that should be preserved.
"Grace and peace in Christ! in Christ, I say, and
not in the world, Amen. I hate with exceeding hatred those
extreme cares which consume you. If the cause is unjust,
abandon it; if the cause is just, why should we belie the
promises of Him who commands us to sleep without fear?
Can the devil do more than kill us? Christ will not be
wanting to the work of justice and of truth. He lives; he
reigns; what fear, then, can we have? God is powerful to
upraise his cause if it is overthrown, to make it proceed if it
remains motionless, and if we are not worthy of it, he will
do it by others.</p>

<p>"I have received your Apology,<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> and I cannot understand
what you mean, when you ask what we must concede to the
Papists. We have already conceded too much. Night and
day I meditate on this affair, turning it over and over, perusing
all Scripture, and the certainty of the truth of our doctrine
continually increases in my mind. With the help of
God, I will not permit a single letter of all that we have said
to be torn from us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PALATINE CHAPEL.</div>

<p>"The issue of this affair torments you, because you cannot
understand it. But if you could, I would not have the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
share in it. God has put it in a 'common place,' that you will
not find either in your rhetoric or in your philosophy: that
place is called Faith.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> It is that in which subsist all things
that we can neither understand nor see. Whoever wishes to
touch them, as you do, will have tears for his sole reward.</p>

<p>"If Christ is not with us, where is he in the whole universe?
If we are not the Church, where, I pray, is the
Church? Is it the Dukes of Bavaria, is it Ferdinand, is it the
Pope, is it the Turk, who is the Church? If we have not
the Word of God, who is it that possesses it?</p>

<p>"Only we must have faith, lest the cause of faith should be
found to be without faith.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p>"If we fall, Christ falls with us, that is to say, the Master
of the world. I would rather fall with Christ, than remain
standing with Cæsar."</p>

<p>Thus wrote Luther. The faith which animated him flowed
from him like torrents of living water. He was indefatigable;
in a single day he wrote to Melancthon, Spalatin, Brenz,
Agricola, and John Frederick, and they were letters full of
life. He was not alone in praying, speaking, and believing.
At the same moment, the Evangelical Christians exhorted
one another everywhere to prayer.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> Such was the arsenal in
which the weapons were forged that the confessors of Christ
wielded before the Diet of Augsburg.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RECOLLECTIONS AND CONTRAST.</div>

<p>VII. At length the 25th June arrived. This was destined
to be the greatest day of the Reformation, and one of the most
glorious in the history of Christianity and of mankind.</p>

<p>As the chapel of the Palatine Palace, where the Emperor
had resolved to hear the Confession, could contain only about
two hundred persons,<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> before three o'clock a great crowd was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
to be seen surrounding the building and thronging the court,
hoping by this means to catch a few words; and many having
gained entrance to the chapel, all were turned out except
those who were not, at the least, councillors to the princes.</p>

<p>Charles took his seat on the throne. The Electors or their
representatives were on his right and left hand; after them
the other princes and states of the Empire. The legate had
refused to appear in this solemnity, lest he should seem by
his presence to authorize the reading of the Confession.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></p>

<p>Then stood up John Elector of Saxony, with his son John
Frederick, Phillip Landgrave of Hesse, the Margrave George
of Brandenburg, Wolfgang Prince of Anhalt, Ernest Duke
of Brunswick-Luneburg, and his brother Francis, and last
of all the deputies of Nuremberg and Reutlingen. Their
air was animated and their features radiant with joy.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> The
apologies of the early Christians, of Tertullian and Justin
Martyr, hardly reached in writing the sovereigns to whom
they were addressed. But now, to hear the new apology of
resuscitated Christianity, behold that puissant Emperor, whose
sceptre, stretching far beyond the columns of Hercules, reaches
the utmost limits of the world, his brother the King of the
Romans, with electors, princes, prelates, deputies, ambassadors,
all of whom desire to destroy the Gospel, but who are
constrained by an invisible power to listen, and, by that very
listening, to honour the Confession!</p>

<p>One thought was involuntarily present in the minds of the
spectators,&mdash;the recollection of the Diet of Worms.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> Only
nine years before, a poor monk stood alone for this same
cause in a hall of the town-house at Worms, in presence of
the Empire. And now in his stead, behold the foremost of
the Electors, behold princes and cities! What a victory is
declared by this simple fact! No doubt Charles himself cannot
escape from this recollection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CONFESSION&mdash;PROLOGUE.</div>

<p>The Emperor, seeing the Protestants stand up, motioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
them to sit down; and then the two chancellors of the
Elector, Bruck and Bayer, advanced to the middle of the
chapel, and stood before the throne, holding in their hands,
the former the Latin, and the other the German copy of the
Confession. The Emperor required the Latin copy to be
read.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> "We are Germans," said the Elector of Saxony, "and
on German soil; I hope therefore your majesty will allow us
to speak German." If the Confession had been read in
Latin, a language unknown to most of the princes, the general
effect would have been lost. This was another means of
shutting the mouth of the Gospel. The Emperor complied
with the Elector's demand.</p>

<p>Bayer then began to read the Evangelical Confession,
slowly, seriously, distinctly, with a clear, strong, and sonorous
voice, which re-echoed under the arched roof of the chapel,
and carried even to the outside this great testimony paid to
the truth.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p>"Most serene, most mighty, and invincible Emperor and
most gracious Lord," said he, "we who appear in your presence,
declare ourselves ready to confer amicably with you
on the fittest means of restoring one sole, true, and same faith,
since it is for one sole and same Christ that we fight.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> And
in case that these religious dissensions cannot be settled amicably,
we then offer to your majesty to explain our cause in
a general, free, and christian council."<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CONFESSION&mdash;JUSTIFICATION.</div>

<p>This prologue being ended, Bayer confessed the Holy Trinity,
conformably with the Nicene Council,<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> original and hereditary
sin, "which bringeth eternal death to all who are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
regenerated,"<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> and the incarnation of the Son, "very God
and very man."<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></p>

<p>"We teach moreover," continued he, "that we cannot be
justified before God by our own strength, our merits, and our
works; but that we are justified by Christ through grace,
through the means of faith,<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> when we believe that our sins
are forgiven in virtue of Christ, who by his death has made
satisfaction for our sins: this faith is the righteousness that
God imputes to the sinner.</p>

<p>"But we teach, at the same time, that this faith ought to
bear good fruits, and that we must do all the good works commanded
by God, for the love of God, and not by their means
to gain the grace of God."</p>

<p>The Protestants next declared their faith in the Christian
Church, "which is," said they, "the assembly of all true believers
and all the saints,"<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> in the midst of whom there are,
nevertheless, in this life, many false Christians, hypocrites
even, and manifest sinners; and they added, "that it was
sufficient for the real unity of the Church that they were
agreed on the doctrine of the Gospel and the administration
of the sacraments, without the rites and ceremonies instituted
by men being everywhere the same."<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>&mdash;They proclaimed the
necessity of baptism, and declared "that the body and blood
of Christ are really present and administered in the Lord's
Supper to those who partake of it."<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CONFESSION&mdash;FAITH.</div>

<p>The Chancellor then successively confessed the faith of the
Evangelical Christians, touching confession, penance, the nature
of the sacraments, the government of the Church, ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
ordinances, political government, and the last judgment.
"As regards Free-will," continued he, "we confess
that man's will has a certain liberty of accomplishing civil
justice, and of loving the things that reason comprehends;
that man can do the good that is within the sphere of nature&mdash;plough
his fields, eat, drink, have a friend, put on a coat,
build a house, take a wife, feed cattle, exercise a calling; as
also he can, of his own movement, do evil, kneel before an
idol, and commit murder. But we maintain that without the
Holy Ghost he cannot do what is righteous in the sight of God."</p>

<p>Then, returning to the grand doctrine of the Reformation,
and recalling to mind that the doctors of the Pope "have never
ceased impelling the faithful to puerile and useless works,
as the custom of chaplets, invocations of saints, monastic
vows, processions, fasts, feast-days, brotherhoods," the Protestants
added, that as for themselves, while urging the practice
of truly Christian works, of which little had been said before
their time,<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> "they taught that man is justified by faith
alone; not by that faith which is a simple knowledge of
the history, and which wicked men and even devils possess,
but by a faith which believes not only the history, but
also the effect of the history;<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> which believes that through
Christ we obtain grace; which sees that in Christ we have
a merciful Father; which knows this God; which calls upon
him; in a word, which is not without God, as the heathen are."</p>

<p>"Such," said Bayer, "is a summary of the doctrine professed
in our Churches, by which it may be seen that this doctrine
is by no means opposed to Scripture, to the universal Church,
nor even to the Romish Church, such as the doctors describe
it to us;<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> and since it is so, to reject us as heretics is
an offence against unity and charity."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">LUTHER ON THE CONFESSION.</div>

<p>Here terminated the first part of the Confession, the aim
of which was to explain the Evangelical doctrine. The
Chancellor read with so distinct a voice, that the crowd which
was unable to enter the hall, and which filled the court and
all the approaches of the episcopal palace, did not lose a
word.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> This reading produced the most marvellous effect
on the princes who thronged the chapel. Jonas watched every
change in their countenances,<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> and there beheld interest, astonishment,
and even approbation depicted by turns. "The
adversaries imagine they have done a wonderful thing, by
forbidding the preaching of the Gospel," wrote Luther to the
Elector; "and they do not see, poor creatures! that by the
reading of the Confession in the presence of the diet, there has
been more preaching than in the sermons of ten preachers.
Exquisite subtlety! admirable expedient! Master Agricola
and the other ministers are reduced to silence; but in their
place appear the Elector of Saxony, and the other princes and
lords, who preach before his imperial majesty, and the members
of the whole Empire, freely, to their beard, and before
their noses. Yes, Christ is in the diet, and he does not keep
silence: <i>the word of God cannot be bound</i>. They forbid it in
the pulpit, and are forced to hear it in the palace; poor ministers
cannot announce it, and great princes proclaim it; the servants
are forbidden to listen to it, and their masters are compelled
to hear it; they will have nothing to do with it during the
whole course of the diet, and they are forced to submit to hear
more in one day than is heard ordinarily in a whole year......When
all else is silent, the very stones cry out, as says our
Lord Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CONFESSION&mdash;ABUSES.</div>

<p>That part of the Confession destined to point out errors and
abuses still remained. Bayer continued: he explained and
demonstrated the doctrine of the two kinds; he attacked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
compulsory celibacy of priests, maintained that the Lord's
Supper had been changed into a regular fair, in which it was
merely a question of buying and selling, and that it had been
re-established in its primitive purity by the Reformation, and
was celebrated in the Evangelical churches with entirely new
devotion and gravity. He declared that the Sacrament was
administered to no one who had not first made confession of
his faults, and he quoted this expression of Chrysostom: "Confess
thyself to God the Lord, thy real Judge; tell thy sin, not
with the tongue, but in thy conscience and in thy heart."</p>

<p>Bayer next came to the precepts on the distinction of meats
and other Roman usages. "Celebrate such a festival," said
he; "repeat such a prayer, or keep such a fast; be dressed in
such a manner, and so many other ordinances of men&mdash;this
is what is now styled a spiritual and christian life; while the
good works prescribed by God, as those of a father of a family
who toils to support his wife, his sons, and his daughters&mdash;of
a mother who brings children into the world, and takes care
of them&mdash;of a prince or of a magistrate who governs his subjects,
are looked upon as secular things, and of an imperfect
nature." As for monastic vows in particular, he represented
that, as the Pope could give a dispensation from them, those
vows ought therefore to be abolished.</p>

<p>The last article of the Confession treated of the authority
of the bishops: powerful princes crowned with the episcopal
mitre were there; the Archbishops of Mentz, Cologne, Salzburg,
and Bremen; the Bishops of Bamberg, Wurzburg,
Eichstadt, Worms, Spire, Strasburg, Augsburg, Constance,
Coire, Passau, Liege, Trent, Brixen, and of Lebus and Ratzburg,
fixed their eyes on the humble confessor. He fearlessly
continued, and energetically protesting against that confusion
of Church and State which had characterized the Middle
Ages, he called for the distinction and independence of the
two societies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CONFESSION&mdash;DUTY OF THE BISHOPS.</div>

<p>"Many," said he, "have unskilfully confounded the episcopal
and the temporal power; and from this confusion have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
resulted great wars, revolts, and seditions.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> It is for this reason,
and to reassure men's consciences, that we find ourselves
constrained to establish the difference which exists between
the power of the Church and the power of the sword.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></p>

<p>"We therefore teach that the power of the keys or of the
bishops is, conformably with the Word of the Lord, a commandment
emanating from God, to preach the Gospel, to remit
or retain sins, and to administer the Sacraments. This
power has reference only to eternal goods, is exercised only
by the minister of the Word, and does not trouble itself with
political administration. The political administration, on the
other hand, is busied with everything else but the Gospel.
The magistrate protects, not souls, but bodies and temporal
possessions. He defends them against all attacks from without,
and, by making use of the sword and of punishment, compels
men to observe civil justice and peace.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a></p>

<p>"For this reason we must take particular care not to mingle
the power of the Church with the power of the State.<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> The
power of the Church ought never to invade an office that is
foreign to it; for Christ himself said: <i>My kingdom is not of
this world</i>. And again: <i>Who made me a judge over you?</i> St.
Paul said to the Philippians: <i>Our citizenship is in heaven</i>.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>
And to the Corinthians: <i>The weapons of our warfare are not
carnal, but mighty through God</i>.</p>

<p>"It is thus that we distinguish the two governments and the
two powers, and that we honour both as the most excellent
gifts that God has given here on earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CONFESSION&mdash;EPILOGUE.</div>

<p>"The duty of the bishops is therefore to preach the Gospel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to forgive sins, to exclude from the Christian Church all who
rebel against the Lord, but without human power, and solely
by the Word of God.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> If the bishops act thus, the churches
ought to be obedient to them according to this declaration of
Christ: <i>Whoever heareth you, heareth me</i>.</p>

<p>"But if the bishops teach anything that is contrary to the
Gospel, then the churches have an order from God which forbids
them to obey (Matt. vii. 15; Galatians i. 8; 2 Cor. xiii.
8, 10). And St. Augustin himself, in his letter against Pertilian,
writes: 'We must not obey the catholic bishops, if they
go astray, and teach anything contrary to the canonical Scriptures
of God.'"<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

<p>After some remarks on the ordinances and traditions of the
Church, Bayer came to the epilogue of the Confession.</p>

<p>"It is not from hatred that we have spoken," added he,
"nor to insult any one; but we have explained the doctrines
that we maintain to be essential, in order that it may be understood
that we admit of neither dogma nor ceremony which
is contrary to the Holy Scriptures, and to the usage of the
universal Church."</p>

<p>Bayer then ceased to read. He had spoken for two hours:
the silence and serious attention of the assembly were not
once disturbed.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<p>This Confession of Augsburg will ever remain one of the
masterpieces of the human mind enlightened by the Spirit
of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REMARKS ON THE CONFESSION.</div>

<p>The language that had been adopted, while it was perfectly
natural, was the result of a profound study of character.
These princes, these warriors, these politicians who were sitting
in the Palatine Palace, entirely ignorant as they were of
divinity, easily understood the Protestant doctrine; for it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
not explained to them in the style of the schools, but in that of
everyday life, and with a simplicity and clearness that rendered
all misunderstanding impossible.</p>

<p>At the same time the power of argumentation was so much
the more remarkable, as it was the more concealed. At one
time Melancthon (for it was really he who spoke through the
mouth of Bayer) was content to quote a single passage of
Scripture or of the Fathers in favour of the doctrine he maintained;
and at another he proved his thesis so much the more
strongly, that he appeared only to be declaring it. With a
single stroke he pointed out the sad consequences that would
follow the rejection of the faith he professed, or with one word
showed its importance for the prosperity of the Church; so
that while listening to him, the most violent enemies were
obliged to acknowledge to themselves that there was really
something to say in favour of the new sect.</p>

<p>To this force of reasoning the Apology added a prudence
no less remarkable. Melancthon, while declining with firmness
the errors attributed to his party, did not even appear to
feel the injustice of these erroneous imputations; and while
pointing out those of Popery, he did not say expressly they
were those of his adversaries; thus carefully avoiding every
thing that might irritate their minds. In this he showed himself
wise as a serpent and harmless as a dove.</p>

<p>But the most admirable thing of all is the fidelity with
which the Confession explains the doctrines most essential to
salvation. Rome is accustomed to represent the Reformers as
the creators of the Protestant doctrines; but it is not in the
sixteenth century that we must look for the days of that creation.
A bright track of light, of which Wickliffe and Augustin
mark the most salient points, carries us back to the
Apostolic age: it was then that shone in all their brilliancy
the creative days of Evangelical truth. Yet it is true (and
if this is what Rome means, we fully concur in the idea) never
since the time of St. Paul had the Christian doctrine appeared
with so much beauty, depth, and life, as in the days of the
Reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REMARKS.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>Among all these doctrines, that of the Church, which had
been so long disfigured, appeared at this time in all its native
purity. With what wisdom, in particular, the confessors of
Augsburg protest against that confusion of religion and politics
which since the deplorable epoch of Constantine, had
changed the kingdom of God into an earthly and carnal institution!
Undoubtedly what the Confession stigmatizes with
the greatest energy is the intrusion of the Church into the affairs
of the State, but can it be thought that it was to approve
the intrusion of the State in Church affairs? The evil
of the Middle Ages was the having enslaved the State to the
Church, and the confessors of Augsburg rose like one man
to combat it. The evil of the three centuries which have
passed away since then, is to have subjected the Church to the
State; and we may believe that Luther and Melancthon
would have found against this disorder thunders no less powerful.
What they attack in a general sense, is the confusion
of the two societies; what they demand, is their independence,
I do not say their separation. If the Augsburg confessors
were unwilling that things from above should monopolize
those of the earth, they would have been still less willing for
things of earth to oppress those from heaven.</p>

<p>There is a particular application of this principle, which
the Confession points out. It wills the bishops should reprimand
those who obey wickedness, "but without human
power, and solely by the Word of God." It therefore rejects
the use of the sword in the chastisement of heretics. This
we see is a primitive principle, fundamental and essential to
the Reformation, as the contrary doctrine is a primitive principle,
fundamental and essential to the Papacy. If among
Protestants we find some writing, or even some example opposed
to this, it is but an isolated fact, which cannot invalidate
the official principles of the Reform&mdash;it is one of those exceptions
which always serve to confirm the rule.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MODERATE TONE OF THE CONFESSION.</div>

<p>Finally, the Augsburg Confession does not usurp the rights
of the Word of God; it desires to be its handmaid and not its
rival; it does not found, it does not regulate the faith, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
simply professes it. "Our churches teach," it says; and it
will be remembered that Luther considered it only as a sermon
preached by princes and kings. Had it desired more, as
has since been maintained, by that very circumstance it
would have been nullified.</p>

<p>Was, however, the Confession able to follow in all things
the exact path of truth? We may be permitted to doubt it.</p>

<p>It professes not to separate from the teaching of the Catholic
Church, and even from that of the Romish Church&mdash;by
which is no doubt signified the ancient Roman Church&mdash;and
rejects the popish particularism which, for about eight
centuries, imprisoned men's consciences. The Confession,
however, seems overlaid with superstitious fears when there
is any question of deviating from the views entertained by
some of the Fathers of the Church, of breaking the toils of
the hierarchy, and of acting, as regards Rome, without blameable
forbearance. This, at least, is what its author, Melancthon,
professes. "We do not put forward any dogma," said
he, "which is not founded on the Gospel or on the teaching
of the Catholic Church; we are prepared to concede everything
that is necessary for the episcopal dignity;<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> and, provided
that the bishops do not condemn the Gospel, we preserve
all the rites that appear indifferent to us. In a word, there is
no burden that we reject, if we can bear it without guilt."<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

<p>Many will think, no doubt, that a little more independence
would have been proper in this matter, and that it would
have been better to have passed over the ages that have followed
the times of the apostles, and have frankly put in practice
the grand principle which the Reformation had proclaimed:
"There is for articles of faith no other foundation than
the Word of God."<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">DEFECTS OF THE CONFESSION.</div>

<p>Melancthon's moderation has been admired; and, in truth,
while pointing out the abuses of Rome, he was silent on
what is most revolting in them, on their disgraceful origin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
their scandalous consequences, and is content to show that
they are in contradiction to the Scripture. But he does
more; he is silent on the divine right of the Pope, on the
number of the sacraments, and on other points besides. His
great business is to justify the renovated, and not to attack
the deformed, Church. "Peace! peace!" was his cry. But
if, instead of all this circumspection, the Reformation had
advanced with courage, had wholly unveiled the Word of
God, and had made an energetic appeal to the sympathies of
reform then spread in men's hearts, would it not have taken
a stronger and more honourable position, and would it not
have secured more extensive conquests?</p>

<p>The interest that Charles the Fifth showed in listening to
the Confession seems doubtful. According to some, he endeavoured
to understand that foreign language;<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> according
to others, he fell asleep.<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> It is easy to reconcile these contradictory
testimonies.</p>

<p>When the reading was finished, Chancellor Brück, with
the two copies in his hand, advanced towards the Emperor's
secretary and presented them to him. Charles the Fifth,
who was wide awake at this moment, himself took the two
Confessions, handed the German copy, considered as official,
to the elector of Mentz, and kept the Latin one for himself.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>
He then made reply to the Elector of Saxony and to his allies
that he had graciously heard their confession;<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> but as this
affair was one of extreme importance, he required time to
deliberate upon it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE AUGSBURG CONFESSION.</div>

<p>The joy with which the Protestants were filled shone
in their eyes.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> God had been with them; and they saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
that the striking act which had so recently been accomplished,
imposed on them the obligation of confessing the
truth with immovable perseverance. "I thrill with joy,"
wrote Luther, "that my life was cast in an epoch in which
Christ is publicly exalted by such illustrious confessors and
in so glorious an assembly."<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> The whole Evangelical
Church, excited and renovated by this public confession of its
representatives, was then more intimately united to its divine
Chief, and baptized with a new baptism. "Since the apostolic
age," said they (these are the words of a contemporary),
"there has never been a greater work or a more magnificent
confession."<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></p>

<p>The Emperor, having descended from his throne, approached
the Protestant princes, and begged them in a low
tone not to publish the Confession;<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> they acceded to his request,
and every one withdrew.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER DEMANDS RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.</div>

<p>VIII. The Romanists had expected nothing like this. Instead
of a hateful controversy, they had heard a striking confession
of Jesus Christ; the most hostile minds were consequently
disarmed. "We would not for a great deal," was
the remark on every side, "have missed being present at
this reading."<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> The effect was so prompt, that for an instant
the cause was thought to be definitively gained. The
bishops themselves imposed silence on the sophisms and clamours
of the Fabers and the Ecks.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> "All that the Lutherans
have said is true," exclaimed the Bishop of Augsburg; "we
cannot deny it."<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>&mdash;"Well, doctor," said the Duke of Bavaria
to Eck, in a reproachful tone, "you had given me a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
different idea of this doctrine and of this affair."<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> This was
the general cry; accordingly the sophists, as they called
them, were embarrassed. "But, after all," said the Duke of
Bavaria to them, "can you refute by sound reasons the
Confession made by the Elector and his allies?"&mdash;"With
the writings of the Apostles and Prophets&mdash;no!" replied
Eck; "but with those of the Fathers and of the Councils&mdash;yes!"<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>
"I understand," quickly replied the Duke; "I
understand. The Lutherans, according to you, are in scripture;
and we are outside."</p>

<p>The Archbishop Hermann, elector of Cologne, the Count-palatine
Frederick, Duke Erick of Brunswick-Luneburg,
Duke Henry of Mecklenburg, and the Dukes of Pomerania,
were gained over to the truth; and Hermann sought erelong
to establish it in his electorate.</p>

<p>The impression produced in other countries by the Confession
was perhaps still greater. Charles sent copies to all the
courts; it was translated into French, Italian,<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> and even into
Spanish and Portuguese; it circulated through all Europe,
and thus accomplished what Luther had said: "Our Confession
will penetrate into every court, and the sound thereof
will go through the whole earth."<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> It destroyed the prejudices
that had been entertained, gave Europe a sounder idea
of the Reformation, and prepared the most distant countries
to receive the seeds of the Gospel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S DOMINANT IDEA.</div>

<p>Then Luther's voice began to be heard again. He saw
that it was a decisive moment, and that he ought now to give
the impulse that would gain religious liberty. He boldly
demanded this liberty of the Roman-catholic princes of the
diet;<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> and at the same time endeavoured to make his friends
quit Augsburg. Jesus Christ had been boldly confessed. Instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of that long series of quarrels and discussions which
was about to become connected with this courageous act,
Luther would have wished for a striking rupture, even should
he seal with his blood the testimony rendered to the Gospel.
The stake, in his idea, would have been the real catastrophe
of this tragedy. "I absolve you from this diet, in the name
of the Lord,"<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> wrote he to his friends. "Now home, return
home, again I say home! Would to God that I were the
sacrifice offered to this new council, as John Huss at Constance!"<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a></p>

<p>But Luther did not expect so glorious a conclusion: he
compared the diet to a drama. First, there had been the
exposition, then the prologue, afterwards the action, and now
he waited for the tragic catastrophe, according to some, but
which, in his opinion, would be merely comic.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> Everything,
he thought, would be sacrificed to political peace, and dogmas
would be set aside. This proceeding, which, even in our
own days, would be in the eyes of the world the height of
wisdom, was in Luther's eyes the height of folly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SONG OF TRIUMPH.</div>

<p>It was the intervention of Charles which especially alarmed
him. To withdraw the Church from all secular influence,
and the governments from all clerical influence, was then
one of the dominant ideas of the great Reformer. "You
see," wrote he to Melancthon, "that they oppose to our cause
the same argument as at Worms, to wit, still and for ever
the judgment of the Emperor. Thus Satan is always harping
on the same string, and that emaciated strength<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> of the
civil power is the only one which this myriad-wiled spirit is
able to find against Jesus Christ." But Luther took courage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and boldly raised his head. "Christ is coming," continued
he; "he is coming, sitting at the right hand......Of whom?
not of the Emperor, or we should long ago have been lost,
but of God himself: let us fear nothing. Christ is the King
of kings and the Lord of lords. If he loses this title at Augsburg,
he must also lose it in all the earth, and in all the
heavens."</p>

<p>Thus a song of triumph was, on the part of the Confessors
of Augsburg, the first movement that followed this courageous
act, unique doubtless in the annals of the Church. Some
of their adversaries at first shared in their triumph, and the
others were silent; but a powerful reaction took place erelong.</p>

<p>On the following morning, Charles having risen in ill-humour
and tired for want of sleep, the first of his ministers
who appeared in the imperial apartments was the Count-palatine,
as wearied and embarrassed as his master. "We
must yield something," said he to Charles; "and I would
remind your majesty that the Emperor Maximilian was willing
to grant the two kinds in the Eucharist, the marriage of
priests, and liberty with respect to the fasts." Charles the
Fifth eagerly seized at this proposition as a means of safety.
But Granvelle and Campeggio soon arrived, who induced him
to withdraw it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN INGENUOUS CONFESSION.</div>

<p>Rome, bewildered for a moment by the blow that had
struck her, rose up again with energy. "I stay with the
mother," exclaimed the Bishop of Wartzburg, meaning by it
the Church of Rome; "the mother, the mother!" "My
lord," wittily replied Brenz, "pray, do not, for the mother,
forget either the Father or the Son!"&mdash;"Well! I grant it,"
replied the Archbishop of Salzburg to one of his friends, "I
also should desire the communion in both kinds, the marriage
of priests, the reformation of the Mass, liberty as regards
food and other traditions......But that it should be a monk,
a poor monk, who presumes to reform us all, is what we cannot
tolerate."<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>&mdash;"I should have no objection," said another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
bishop, "for the Divine worship to be celebrated everywhere
as it is at Wittemberg; but we can never consent that
this new doctrine should issue from such a corner."<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> And
Melancthon insisting with the Archbishop of Salzburg on the
necessity of a reform of the clergy: "Well! and how can
you wish to reform us?" said the latter abruptly: "we
priests have always been good for nothing." This is one of
the most ingenuous confessions that the Reformation has
torn from the priests. Every day fanatical monks and doctors,
brimful of sophisms, were seen arriving at Augsburg,
who endeavoured to inflame the hatred of the Emperor and
of the princes.<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> "If we formerly had friends," said Melancthon
on the morrow of the Confession, "now we possess
them no longer. We are here alone, abandoned by all, and
contending against measureless dangers."<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">FAILURE OF THE POPISH INTRIGUES.</div>

<p>Charles, impelled by these contrary parties, affected a
great indifference. But without permitting it to be seen, he
endeavoured, meanwhile, to examine this affair thoroughly.
"Let there not be a word wanting," he had said to his secretary,
when requiring from him a French translation of the
Confession. "He does not allow anything to be observed,"
whispered the Protestants one to another, convinced that
Charles was gained; "for if it were known, he would lose his
Spanish states: let us maintain the most profound secresy."
But the Emperor's courtiers, who perceived these strange
hopes, smiled and shook their heads. "If you have money,"
said Schepper, one of the secretaries of state, to Jonas and
Melancthon, "it will be easy for you to buy from the Italians
whatever religion you please;<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> but if your purse is empty,
your cause is lost." Then assuming a more serious tone:
"It is impossible," said he, "for the Emperor, surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
as he is by bishops and cardinals, to approve of any other
religion than that of the Pope."</p>

<p>This was soon evident. On the day after the confession
(Sunday, 26th June), before the breakfast hour,<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> all the deputations
from the imperial cities were collected in the Emperor's
antechamber. Charles, desirous of bringing back the
states of the Empire to unity, began with the weakest. "Some
of the cities," said the count palatine, "have not adhered to
the last Diet of Spire: the Emperor calls upon them to submit
to it."</p>

<p>Strasburg, Nuremberg, Constance, Ulm, Reutlingen, Heilbronn,
Memmingen, Lindau, Kempten, Windsheim, Isny, and
Weissemburg, which were thus summoned to renounce the
famous protest, found the moment curiously chosen. They
asked for time.</p>

<p>The position was complicated; discord had been thrown in
the midst of the cities, and intrigue was labouring daily to increase
it.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> It was not only between the Popish and the
Evangelical cities that disagreement existed; but also between
the Zwinglian and the Lutheran cities, and even among
the latter, those which had not adhered to the Confession of
Augsburg manifested great ill-humour towards the deputies of
Reutlingen and Nuremberg. This proceeding of Charles the
Fifth was therefore skilfully calculated; for it was based on
the old axiom, <i>Divide et impera</i>.</p>

<p>But the enthusiasm of faith overcame all these stratagems,
and on the next day (27th June), the deputies from the cities
transmitted a reply to the Emperor, in which they declared
that they could not adhere to the <i>Recess</i> of Spire "without
disobeying God, and without compromising the salvation of
their souls."<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EMPEROR'S COUNCIL.</div>

<p>Charles, who desired to observe a just medium, more from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
policy than from equity, wavered between so many contrary
convictions. Desirous nevertheless of essaying his mediating
influence, he convoked the states faithful to Rome on Sunday,
26th June, shortly after his conference with the cities.</p>

<p>All the princes were present: even the Pope's legate and
the most influential Roman divines appeared at this council,
to the great scandal of the Protestants. "What reply should
be made to the Confession?" was the question set by Charles
the Fifth to the senate that surrounded him.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a></p>

<p>Three different opinions were proposed. "Let us beware,"
said the men of the Papacy, "of discussing our adversaries'
reasons, and let us be content with executing the Edict of
Worms against the Lutherans, and with constraining them
by arms."<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>&mdash;"Let us submit the Confession to the examination
of impartial judges," said the men of the Empire, "and
refer the final decision to the Emperor. Is not even the
reading of the Confession an appeal of the Protestants to the
imperial power?" Others, in the last place (and these were
the men of tradition and of ecclesiastical doctrine), were
desirous of commissioning certain doctors to compose a refutation,
which should be read to the Protestants and ratified
by Charles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VIOLENT DISCUSSIONS.</div>

<p>The debate was very animated: the mild and the violent,
the politic and the fanatical, took a decided course in the
assembly. George of Saxony and Joachim of Brandenburg
showed themselves the most inveterate, and surpassed in this
respect even the ecclesiastical princes.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> "A certain clown,
whom you know well, is pushing them all from behind,"<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>
wrote Melancthon to Luther; "and certain hypocritical
theologians hold the torch and lead the whole band." This
clown was doubtless Duke George. Even the Princes of
Bavaria, whom the Confession had staggered at first, immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
rallied around the chiefs of the Roman party. The
Elector of Mentz, the Bishop of Augsburg, the Duke of Brunswick,
showed themselves the least unfavourable to the Evangelical
cause. "I can by no means advise his majesty to
employ force," said Albert. "If his majesty should constrain
their consciences, and should afterwards quit the Empire,
the first victims sacrificed would be the priests; and who
knows whether, in the midst of these discords, the Turks would
not suddenly fall upon us?" But this somewhat interested
wisdom of the archbishop did not find many supporters, and
the men of war immediately plunged into the discussion with
their harsh voices. "If there is any fighting against the
Lutherans," said Count Felix of Werdenburg, "I gratuitously
offer my sword, and I swear never to return it to its
scabbard until it has overthrown the stronghold of Luther."
This nobleman died suddenly a few days after, from the consequences
of his intemperance. Then the moderate men
again interfered: "The Lutherans attack no one article of
the faith," said the Bishop of Augsburg; "let us come to an
arrangement with them; and to obtain peace, let us concede
to them the sacrament in both kinds and the marriage of
priests. I would even yield more, if it were necessary."
Upon this great cries arose: "He is a Lutheran," they
exclaimed, "and you will see that he is fully prepared to
sacrifice even the private masses!"&mdash;"The masses! we
must not even think of it," remarked some with an ironical
smile; "Rome will never give them up, for it is they which
maintain her cardinals and her courtiers, with their luxury
and their kitchens."<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> The Archbishop of Salzburg and the
Elector of Brandenburg replied with great violence to the
motion of the Bishop of Augsburg. "The Lutherans," said
they abruptly, "have laid before us a Confession written with
black ink on white paper. Well! If I were Emperor, I
would answer them with <i>red ink</i>."<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>&mdash;"Sirs," quickly replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the Bishop of Augsburg, "take care then that the red letters
do not fly in your faces!" The Elector of Mentz was compelled
to interfere and calm the speakers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A REFUTATION PROPOSED.</div>

<p>The Emperor, desirous of playing the character of an
umpire, would have wished the Roman party at least to have
placed in his hands an accusation against the Reform: but all
was now altered; the majority, becoming daily more compact
since the Diet of Spire, no longer sided with Charles. Full
of the sentiment of its own strength, it refused to assume the
title of a party, and to take the Emperor as a judge. "What
are you saying," cried they, "of diversity between the members
of the Empire? There is but one legitimate party. It
is not a question of deciding between two opinions whose
rights are equal, but of crushing rebels, and of aiding those
who have remained faithful to the constitution of the Empire."</p>

<p>This haughty language enlightened Charles: he found
they had outstripped him, and that, abandoning his lofty position
of arbiter, he must submit merely to be the executer of
the orders of the majority. It was this majority which henceforward
commanded in Augsburg. They excluded the imperial
councillors who advocated more equitable views, and
the Archbishop of Mentz himself ceased for a time to appear
in the diet.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>

<p>The majority ordered that a refutation of the Evangelical
doctrine should be immediately drawn up by Romish theologians.
If they had selected for this purpose moderate men
like the Bishop of Augsburg, the Reformation would still have
had some chance of success with the great principles of Christianity;
but it was to the enemies of the Reform, to the old
champions of Rome and of Aristotle, exasperated by so many
defeats, that they resolved to intrust this task.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS AUTHORS.</div>

<p>They were numerous at Augsburg, and were not held in
great esteem. "The princes," said Jonas, "have brought
their learned men with them, and some even their <i>unlearned</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and their fools."<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> Provost Faber and Doctor Eck led the
troop; behind them was drawn up a cohort of monks, and
above all of Dominicans, tools of the Inquisition, and impatient
to recompense themselves for the opprobrium they had
so long endured. There was the provincial of the Dominicans,
Paul Hugo, their vicar, John Bourkard, one of their
priors, Conrad Koelein, who had written against Luther's
marriage; with a large body of Carthusians, Augustines,
Franciscans, and vicars of several bishops. Such were the
men who, to the number of twenty, were commissioned to
refute Melancthon.</p>

<p>One might beforehand have augured of the work by the
workmen. Each one understood that it was a question, not
of refuting the Confession, but of branding it. Campeggio,
who doubtless suggested this ill-omened list to Charles, was
well aware that these doctors were incapable of measuring
themselves with Melancthon; but their names formed the
most decided standard of Popery, and announced to the world
clearly and immediately what the diet proposed to do. This
was the essential point. Rome would not leave Christendom
even hope.</p>

<p>It was, however, requisite to know whether the diet, and
the Emperor who was its organ, had the right of pronouncing
in this purely religious matter. Charles put the question
both to the Evangelicals and to the Romanists.<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a></p>

<p>"Your highness," said Luther, who was consulted by the
Elector, "may reply with all assurance: Yes, if the Emperor
wish it, let him be judge! I will bear everything on his
part; but let him decide nothing contrary to the Word of
God. Your highness cannot put the Emperor above God himself.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>
Does not the first commandment say, <i>Thou shalt have
no other Gods before me</i>!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROME AND THE CIVIL POWER.</div>

<p>The reply of the Papal adherents was quite as positive in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
a contrary sense. "We think," said they, "that his majesty,
in accord with the electors, princes, and states of the
Empire, has the right to proceed in this affair, as Roman Emperor,
guardian, advocate, and sovereign protector of the
Church and of our most holy faith."<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> Thus, in the first
days of the Reformation, the Evangelical Church frankly
ranged itself under the throne of Jesus Christ, and the Roman
Church under the sceptre of kings. Enlightened men, even
among Protestants, have misunderstood this double nature of
Protestantism and Popery.</p>

<p>The philosophy of Aristotle and the hierarchy of Rome,
thanks to this alliance with the civil power, were at length
about to see the day of their long-expected triumph arrive.
So long as the schoolmen had been left to the force of their
syllogisms and of their abuse, they had been defeated; but
now Charles the Fifth and the diet held out their hands to
them; the reasonings of Faber, Eck, and Wimpina were
about to be countersigned by the German chancellor, and
confirmed by the great seals of the Empire. Who could resist
them? The Romish error has never had any strength
except by its union with the secular arm; and its victories
in the Old and in the New World are owing, even in our
days, to state patronage.<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PERILS OF THE CONFESSORS.</div>

<p>These things did not escape the piercing eye of Luther.
He saw at once the weakness of the argument of the Papist
doctors and the power of Charles's arm. "You are waiting
for your adversaries' answer," wrote he to his friends in
Augsburg; "it is already written, and here it is: The
Fathers, the Fathers, the Fathers; the Church, the Church,
the Church; usage, custom; but of the Scriptures&mdash;&mdash;nothing!"<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>&mdash;"Then
the Emperor, supported by the testimony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
of these arbiters, will pronounce against you;<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> and then will
you hear boastings from all sides that wilt ascend up to heaven,
and threats that will descend even to hell."</p>

<p>Thus changed the situation of the Reform. Charles was
obliged to acknowledge his weakness; and, to save the appearance
of his power, he took a decisive part with the enemies
of Luther. The Emperor's impartiality disappeared: the
state turned against the Gospel, and there remained for it no
other saviour than God.</p>

<p>At first many gave way to extreme dejection: above all,
Melancthon, who had a nearer view of the cabals of the adversaries,
exhausted moreover by long vigils, fell almost into
despair.<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> "In the presence of these formidable evils," cried
he, "I see no more hope."<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> And then, however, he added&mdash;"Except
the help of God."</p>

<p>The legate immediately set all his batteries to work. Already
had Charles several times sent for the Elector and the
Landgrave, and had used every exertion to detach them from
the Evangelical Confession.<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> Melancthon, uneasy at these
secret conferences, reduced the Confession to its <i>minimum</i>,
and entreated the Elector to demand only the two kinds in the
Eucharist and the marriage of priests. "To interdict the
former of these points," said he, "would be to alienate a
great number of Christians from the communion; and to interdict
the second would be depriving the Church of all the
pastors capable of edifying it. Will they destroy religion
and kindle civil war, rather than apply to these purely
ecclesiastical constitutions a mitigation that is neither contrary
to sound morals nor to faith?"<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> The Protestant princes
begged Melancthon to go himself and make these proposals to
the legate.<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">THE EMPEROR'S SISTER.</div>

<p>Melancthon agreed: he began to flatter himself with success;
and, in truth, there were, even among the Papists, individuals
who were favourable to the Reformation. There
had recently arrived at Augsburg, from beyond the Alps,
certain propositions tolerably Lutheran;<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> and one of the Emperor's
confessors boldly professed the doctrine of justification
by faith, cursing "those asses of Germans, who cease not,"
said he, "from braying against this truth."<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> One of
Charles's chaplains approved even the whole of the Confession.
There was something farther still; Charles the Fifth
having consulted the grandees of Spain, who were famous for
their orthodoxy: "If the opinions of the Protestants are contrary
to the articles of the faith," they had replied, "let your
majesty employ all his power to destroy this faction; but if
it is a question merely of certain changes in human ordinances
and external usages, let all violence be avoided."<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>
"Admirable reply!" exclaimed Melancthon, who persuaded
himself that the Romish doctrine was at the bottom in accordance
with the Gospel.</p>

<p>The Reformation found defenders in even still higher stations.
Mary, sister of Charles the Fifth, and widow of King
Louis of Hungary, arriving at Augsburg three days after the
reading of the Confession, with her sister-in-law the Queen
of Bohemia, Ferdinand's wife, assiduously studied the Holy
Scriptures; she carried them with her in the hunting parties,
in which she found little pleasure, and had discovered therein
the jewel of the Reform,&mdash;the doctrine of gratuitous salvation.
This pious princess made her chaplain read evangelical sermons
to her, and often endeavoured, although with prudence,
to appease her brother Charles with regard to the Protestants.<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">VACILLATION OF MELANCTHON.</div>

<p>Melancthon, encouraged by these demonstrations, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the same time alarmed by the threats of war that the adversaries
did not cease from uttering, thought it his duty to
purchase peace at any cost, and resolved in consequence to
descend in his propositions as low as possible. He therefore
demanded an interview with the legate in a letter whose
authenticity has been unreasonably doubted.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> At the decisive
moment the heart of the Reform champion fails&mdash;his
head turns&mdash;he staggers&mdash;he falls; and in his fall he runs
the risk of dragging with him the cause which martyrs have
already watered with their blood.</p>

<p>Thus speaks the representative of the Reformation to the
representative of the Papacy:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is no doctrine in which we differ from the Roman
Church;<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> we venerate the universal authority of the Roman
Pontiff, and we are ready to obey him, provided he does not
reject us, and that of his clemency, which he is accustomed
to show towards all nations, he will kindly pardon or approve
certain little things that it is no longer possible for us to
change......Now then, will you reject those who appear
as suppliants before you? Will you pursue them with fire
and sword?......Alas! nothing draws upon us in Germany
so much hatred, as the unshaken firmness with which
we maintain the doctrines of the Roman Church.<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> But with
the aid of God, we will remain faithful, even unto death, to
Christ and to the Roman Church, although you should reject
us."<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER OPPOSES CONCESSION.</div>

<p>Thus did Melancthon humble himself. God permitted
this fall, that future ages might clearly see how low the Reform
was willing to descend in order to maintain unity, and
that no one might doubt that the schism had come from
Rome; but also assuredly that they might learn how great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
in every important work is the weakness of the noblest instruments.</p>

<p>Fortunately there was then another man who upheld the
honour of the Reformation. At this very time Luther wrote
to Melancthon: "There can be no concord between Christ
and Belial. As far as regards me, I will not yield a hair's
breadth.<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> Sooner than yield, I should prefer suffering everything,
even the most terrible evils. Concede so much the
less, as your adversaries require the more. God will not aid
us until we are abandoned by all."<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> And fearing some
weakness on the part of his friends, Luther added: "If it
were not tempting God, you would long ago have seen me at
your side!"<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a></p>

<p>Never, in fact, had Luther's presence been so necessary,
for the legate had consented to an interview, and Melancthon
was about to pay court to Campeggio.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></p>

<p>The 8th July was the day appointed by the legate. His
letter inspired Philip with the most sanguine hopes. "The
cardinal assures me that he will accede the usage of the two
kinds, and the marriage of priests," said he; "I am eager
to visit him!"<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">SCHEME OF THE ROMISH DOCTORS.</div>

<p>This visit might decide the destiny of the Church. If the
legate accepted Philip's <i>ultimatum</i>, the Evangelical countries
would be replaced under the power of the Romish bishops,
and all would have been over with the Reformation; but it
was saved through the pride and blindness of Rome. The
Papists, believing it on the brink of the abyss, thought that
a last blow would settle it, and resolved, like Luther, to concede
nothing, "not even a hair's breadth." The legate,
however, even while refusing, assumed an air of kindness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and of yielding to foreign influence. "I might have the
power of making certain concessions, but it would not be
prudent to use it without the consent of the German princes;<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>
their will must be done; one of them in particular conjures
the Emperor to prevent us from yielding the least thing.
I can grant nothing." The Roman prince, with the most
amiable smile, then did all he could to gain the chief of the
Protestant teachers. Melancthon retired filled with shame
at the advances he had made, but still deceived by Campeggio.
"No doubt," said he, "Eck and Cochl&oelig;us have been beforehand
with me at the legate's."<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> Luther entertained a different
opinion. "I do not trust to any of these Italians," said he;
"they are scoundrels. When an Italian is good, he is very
good; but then he is a black swan."</p>

<p>It was truly the Italians who were concerned. Shortly
after the 12th of July arrived the Pope's instructions. He
had received the confession by express<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> and sixteen days
had sufficed for the transmission, the deliberation, and the
return. Clement would hear no mention either of discussions
or of council. Charles was to march straight to the mark,
to send an army into Germany, and stifle the Reformation by
force. At Augsburg, however, it was thought best not to go
so quickly to work, and recourse was had to other means.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MELANCTHON'S EXPLANATION.</div>

<p>"Be quiet; we have them," said the Romish doctors.
Sensible of the reproach that had been made against them, of
having misrepresented the Reformation, they accused the
Protestants themselves as being the cause. "These it is,"
they said, "who, to give themselves an air of being in accord
with us, now dissemble their heresy; but we will now catch
them in their own nets. If they confess to not having inserted
in their Confession all that they reject, it will be proved
that they are trifling with us. If, on the contrary, they pretend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
to have said everything, they will by that very circumstance
be compelled to admit all that they have not condemned."
The Protestant princes were therefore called together,
and they were asked if the Reformation was confined
to the doctrines indicated in the Apology, or if there was
something more.<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a></p>

<p>The snare was skilfully laid. The Papacy had not even
been mentioned in Melancthon's paper; other errors besides
had been omitted, and Luther himself complained of it aloud.
"Satan sees clearly," said he, "that your Apology has passed
lightly over the articles of purgatory, the worship of saints,
and, above all, of the Pope and of Antichrist." The princes
requested to confer with their allies of the towns; and all the
Protestants assembled to deliberate on this momentous incident.</p>

<p>They, looked for Melancthon's explanation, who did not decline
the responsibility of the affair. Easily dejected through
his own anxiety, he became bold whenever he was directly
attacked. "All the essential doctrines," said he, "have
been set forth in the Confession, and every error and abuse
that is opposed to them has been pointed out. But was it
necessary to plunge into all those questions so full of contention
and animosity, that are discussed in our universities?
Was it necessary to ask if all Christians are priests, if the primacy
of the Pope is of right divine, if there can be indulgences,
if every good work is a deadly sin, if there are more
than seven sacraments, if they may be administered by a
layman, if divine election has any foundation in our own
merits, if sacerdotal consecration impresses an indelible character,
if auricular confession is necessary to salvation?......No,
no! all these things are in the province of the schools,
and by no means essential to faith."<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE REFUTATION.</div>

<p>It cannot be denied that in the questions thus pointed out
by Melancthon there were important points. However that
may be, the Evangelical committee were soon agreed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
on the morrow they gave an answer to Charles's ministers,
drawn up with as much frankness as firmness, in which they
said "that the Protestants, desirous of arriving at a cordial
understanding, had not wished to complicate their situation,
and had proposed not to specify all the errors that had been
introduced into the Church, but to confess all the doctrines
that were essential to salvation; that if, nevertheless, the
adverse party felt itself urged to maintain certain abuses, or
to put forward any point not mentioned in the Confession, the
Protestants declared themselves ready to reply in conformity
with the Word of God."<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> The tone of this answer showed
pretty clearly that the Evangelical Christians did not fear
to follow their adversaries wherever the latter should call
them. Accordingly the Roman party said no more on this
business.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>IX. The commission charged to refute the Confession
met twice a day,<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> and each of the theologians who composed
it added to it his refutation and his hatred.</p>

<p>On the 13th July the work was finished. "Eck with his
band,"<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> said Melancthon, "transmitted it to the Emperor."
Great was the astonishment of this prince and of his ministers
at seeing a work of two hundred and eighty pages filled with
abuse.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> "Bad workmen lose much wood," said Luther,
"and impious writers soil much paper." This was not all: to
the Refutation were subjoined eight appendices on the heresies
that Melancthon had dissembled (as they said), and wherein
they exposed the contradictions and "the horrible sects" to
which Lutheranism had given birth. Lastly, not confining
themselves to this official answer, the Romish theologians,
who saw the sun of power shining upon them, filled Augsburg
with insolent and abusive pamphlets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">CHARLES'S DISSATISFACTION.</div>

<p>There was but one opinion on the Papist Refutation; it was
found confused, violent, thirsting for blood.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> Charles the
Fifth had too much good taste not to perceive the difference
that existed between this coarse work and the noble dignity
of Melancthon's Confession. He rolled, handled, crushed,
and so damaged the 280 pages of his doctors, that when he
returned them two days after, says Spalatin, there were not
more than twelve entire. Charles would have been ashamed
to have such a pamphlet read in the diet, and he required, in
consequence, that it should be drawn up anew, shorter and
more moderate.<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> That was not easy, "for the adversaries,
confused and stupified," says Brenz, "by the noble simplicity
of the Evangelical Confession, neither knew where to
begin nor where to end; they accordingly took nearly three
weeks to do their work over again."<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a></p>

<p>Charles and his ministers had great doubts of its success;
leaving, therefore, the theologians for a moment, they imagined
another man&oelig;uvre. "Let us take each of the
Protestant princes separately," said they: "isolated, they will
not resist." Accordingly, on the 15th July, the Margrave
of Brandenburg was visited by his two cousins, the Electors
of Mentz and of Brandenburg, and by his two brothers the
Margraves Frederick and John Albert. "Abandon this,
new faith," said they to him, "and return to that which existed
a century ago. If you do so, there are no favours
that you may not expect from the Emperor; if not, dread his
anger."<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SWISS AT AUGSBURG</div>

<p>Shortly after, the Duke Frederick of Bavaria, the Count
of Nassau, De Rogendorf, and Truchses were announced to
the Elector on the part of Charles. "You have solicited the
Emperor," said they, "to confirm the marriage of your son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
with the Princess of Juliers, and to invest you with the

renounce the heresy of Luther, of which you are the principal
abettor, he cannot accede to your demand." At the
same time the Duke of Bavaria, employing the most urgent
solicitations, accompanied with the most animated gestures<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>
and the most sinister threats,<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> called upon the Elector to
abandon his faith. "It is asserted," added Charles's envoys,
"that you have made an alliance with the Swiss. The Emperor
cannot believe it; and he orders you to let him know
the truth."</p>

<p>The Swiss! it was the same thing as rebellion. This alliance
was the phantom incessantly invoked at Augsburg to
alarm Charles the Fifth. And in reality deputies or at least
friends of the Swiss, had already appeared in that city, and
thus rendered the position still more serious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE'S CONFESSION.</div>

<p>Bucer had arrived two days before the reading of the Confession,
and Capito on the day subsequent to it.<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> There was
even a report that Zwingle would join them.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> But for a long
time all in Augsburg, except the Strasburg deputation, were
ignorant of the presence of these doctors.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> It was only
twenty-one days after their arrival that Melancthon learnt it
positively,<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> so great was the mystery in which the Zwinglians
were forced to enshroud themselves. This was not without
reason: a conference with Melancthon having been requested
by them: "Let them write," replied he; "I should
compromise our cause by an interview with them."</p>

<p>
Bucer and Capito in their retreat, which was like a prison
to them, had taken advantage of their leisure to draw up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
<i>Tetrapolitan Confession</i>, or the confessions of the four cities.
The deputies of Strasburg, Constance, Nemmingen, and Lindau,
presented it to the Emperor.<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> These cities purged
themselves from the reproach of war and revolt that had been
continually objected against them. They declared that their
only motive was Christ's glory, and professed the truth
"freely, boldly, but without insolence and without scurrility."<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></p>

<p>Zwingle about the same time caused a private confession
to be communicated to Charles,<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> which excited a general
uproar. "Does he not dare to say," exclaimed the Romanists,
"that the <i>mitred and withered race</i> (by which he means the
bishops) is in the Church what hump-backs and the scrofula
are in the body?"<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>&mdash;"Does he not insinuate," said the Lutherans;
"that we are beginning to look back after the
onions and garlic of Egypt?"&mdash;"One might say with great
truth that he had lost his senses," exclaimed Melancthon.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>
"All ceremonies, according to him, ought to be abolished;
all the bishops ought to be suppressed. In a word, all is perfectly
<i>Helvetic</i>, that is to say, supremely barbarous."</p>

<p>One man formed an exception to this concert of reproaches,
and this was Luther. "Zwingle pleases me tolerably,"
wrote he to Jonas, "as well as Bucer."<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> By Bucer, he meant
no doubt the Tetrapolitan Confession: this expression should
be noted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AFFLICTING DIVISIONS.</div>

<p>Thus three confessions laid at the feet of Charles the Fifth,
attested the divisions that were rending Protestantism. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
vain did Bucer and Capito endeavour to come to an understanding
with Melancthon, and write to him: "We will meet
where you will, and when you will; we will bring Sturm
alone with us, and if you desire it, we will not even bring
him."<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> All was unavailing. It is not enough for a Christian
to confess Christ; one disciple should confess another
disciple, even if the latter lies under the shame of the world;
but they did not then comprehend this duty. "Schism is in
the schism," said the Romanists, and the Emperor flattered
himself with an easy victory. "Return to the Church," was
the cry from every side, "which means," interrupted the
Strasburgers, "let us put the bit in your mouths, that we may
lead you as we please."<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a></p>

<p>All these things deeply afflicted the Elector, who was besides
still under the burden of Charles's demands and threats.
The Emperor had not once spoken to him,<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> and it was everywhere
said that his cousin George of Saxony would be proclaimed
Elector in his stead.</p>

<p>On the 28th July, there was a great festival at the court.
Charles, robed in his imperial garments, whose value was
said to exceed 200,000 gold ducats, and displaying an air of
majesty which impressed respect and fear,<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> conferred on
many princes the investiture of their dignities; the Elector
alone was excluded from these favours. Erelong he was
made to understand more plainly what was reserved for him,
and it was insinuated, that if he did not submit, the Emperor
would expel him from his states, and inflict upon him the
severest punishment.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ELECTOR'S FAITH.</div>

<p>The Elector turned pale, for he doubted not that such
would certainly be the termination. How with his small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
territory could he resist that powerful monarch who had just
vanquished France and Italy, and now saw Germany at his
feet? And besides, if he could do it, had he the right?
Frightful nightmares pursued John in his dreams. He beheld
himself stretched beneath an immense mountain under which
he struggled painfully, while his cousin George of Saxony
stood on the summit and seemed to brave him.</p>

<p>John at length came forth from this furnace. "I must
either renounce God or the world," said he. "Well! my
choice is not doubtful. It is God who made me Elector,&mdash;me,
who was not worthy of it. I fling myself into his arms,
and let him do with me what shall seem good to him." Thus
the Elector by faith stopped the mouths of lions and subdued
kingdoms.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a></p>

<p>All evangelical Christendom had taken part in the struggle
of John the Persevering. It was seen that if he should
now fall, all would fall with him; and they endeavoured to
support him. "Fear not," cried the Christians of Magdeburg,
"for your highness is under Christ's banner."<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> "Italy
is in expectation," wrote they from Venice; "if for Christ's
glory you must die, fear nothing."<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> But it was from a
higher source that John's courage was derived. "I beheld
Satan as lightning fall from heaven," said his Master.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>
The Elector, in like manner, beheld in his dreams George
fall from the top of the mountain, and lie dashed in pieces
at his feet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EMPEROR'S FAITH.</div>

<p>Once resolved to lose everything, John, free, happy, and
tranquil, assembled his theologians. These generous men desired
to save their master. "Gracious lord," said Spalatin,
"recollect that the Word of God, being the sword of the
Spirit, must be upheld, not by the secular power, but by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
hand of the Almighty."<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>&mdash;"Yes!" said all the doctors,
"we do not wish that, to save us, you should risk your
children, your subjects, your states, your crown......We
will rather give ourselves into the hands of the enemy, and
conjure him to be satisfied with our blood."<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> John, touched
by this language, refused, however, their solicitations, and
firmly repeated these words, which had become his device:
"I also desire to confess my Saviour."</p>

<p>It was on the 20th July that he replied to the pressing arguments
by which Charles had endeavoured to shake him.
He proved to the Emperor that, being his brother's legitimate
heir, he could not refuse him the investiture, which,
besides, the Diet of Worms had secured to him. He added,
that he did not blindly believe what his doctors said, but that,
having recognised the Word of God to be the foundation of
their teaching, he confessed anew, and without any hesitation,
all the articles of the Apology. "I therefore entreat
your majesty," continued he, "to permit me and mine to render
an account to God alone of what concerns the salvation of
our souls."<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> The Margrave of Brandenburg made the
same reply. Thus failed this skilful man&oelig;uvre, by which
the Romanists had hoped to break the strength of the Reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE REFUTATION.</div>

<p>Six weeks had elapsed since the Confession, and yet no
reply. "The Papists, from the moment they heard the
Apology," it was said, "suddenly lost their voice."<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> At
length the Romish theologians handed their revised and corrected
performance to the Emperor, and persuaded this prince
to present it in his own name. The mantle of the state
seemed to them admirably adapted to the movements of
Rome. "These sycophants," said Melancthon, "have desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
to clothe themselves with the lion's skin, to appear to us
so much the more terrible."<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> All the states of the Empire
were convoked for the next day but one.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, 3d August, at two o'clock in the afternoon,
the Emperor, sitting on his throne in the chapel of the Palatinate
Palace, surrounded by his brother, and the electors,
princes, and deputies, the Elector of Saxony and his allies
were introduced, and the Count-palatine, who was called
"Charles's mouthpiece," said to them: "His majesty having
handed your Confession to several doctors of different nations,
illustrious by their knowledge, their morals, and their
impartiality, has read their reply with the greatest care, and
submits it to you as his own, ordaining that all the members
and subjects of the Holy Empire should accept it with unanimous
accord."<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<p>Alexander Schweiss then took the papers and read the
refutation. The Roman party approved some articles of the
Confession, condemned others, and in certain less salient
passages, it distinguished between what must be rejected and
what accepted.</p>

<p>It gave way on an important point; the <i>opus operatum</i>.
The Protestants having said in their 13th Article that faith
was necessary in the Sacrament, the Romish party assented
to it; thus abandoning an error which the Papacy had so
earnestly defended against Luther in that very city of Augsburg,
by the mouth of Cajetan.</p>

<p>Moreover, they recognised as truly Christian the Evangelical
doctrine on the Trinity, on Christ, on baptism, on eternal
punishment, and on the origin of evil.</p>

<p>But on all the other points, Charles, his princes, and his
theologians, declared themselves immovable. They maintained
that men are born with the fear of God, that good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
works are meritorious, and that they justify in union with
faith. They upheld the Seven Sacraments, the Mass, transubstantiation,
the withdrawal of the cup, the celibacy of
priests, the invocation of saints, and they denied that the
Church was an assembly of the saints.</p>

<p>This Refutation was skilful in some respects, and, above
all, in what concerned the doctrine of works and of faith. But
on other points, in particular on the withdrawal of the cup
and the celibacy of priests, its arguments were lamentably
weak, and contrary to the well known facts of history.</p>

<p>While the Protestants had taken their stand on the Scriptures,
their adversaries supported the divine origin of the
hierarchy, and laid down absolute submission to its laws.
Thus, the essential character, which still distinguishes Rome
from the Reformation, stood prominently forth in this first
combat.</p>

<p>Among the auditors who filled the chapel of the Palatinate
Palace, concealed in the midst of the deputies of Nuremberg,
was Joachim Camerarius, who, while Schweiss was reading,
leant over his tablets and carefully noted down all he could
collect. At the same time others of the Protestants, speaking
to one another, were indignant, and even laughed, as one of
their opponents assures us.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> "Really," said they with one
consent, "the whole of this Refutation is worthy of Eck, Faber,
and Cochl&oelig;us!"</p>

<p>As for Charles, little pleased with these theological dissertations,
he slept during the reading;<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> but he awoke when
Schweiss had finished, and his awakening was that of a lion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IMPERIAL COMMANDS.</div>

<p>The Count-palatine then declared that his majesty found
the articles of this Refutation orthodox, catholic, and conformable
to the Gospel; that he therefore required the Protestants
to abandon their Confession, now refuted, and to adhere to all
the articles that had just been set forth;<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> that, if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
refused, the Emperor would remember his office, and would
know how to show himself the advocate and defender of the
Roman Church.</p>

<p>This language was clear enough: the adversaries imagined
they had refuted the Protestants by commanding the latter to
consider themselves beaten. Violence&mdash;arms&mdash;war&mdash;were
all contained in these cruel words of Charles's minister.<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> The
princes represented that, as the Refutation adopted some of
their articles and rejected others, it required a careful examination,
and they consequently begged a copy should be given
them.</p>

<p>The Romish party had a long conference on this demand:
night was at hand; the Count-palatine replied that, considering
the late hour and the importance of this affair, the Emperor
would make known his pleasure somewhat later. The
diet separated, and Charles the Fifth, exasperated at the audacity
of the Evangelical princes, says Cochl&oelig;us, returned in
ill-humour to his apartments.<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></p>

<p>The Protestants, on the contrary, withdrew full of peace;
the reading of the Refutation having given them as much
confidence as that of the Confession itself.<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> They saw in
their adversaries a strong attachment to the hierarchy, but a
great ignorance of the Gospel&mdash;a characteristic feature of the
Romish party; and this thought encouraged them. "Certainly,"
said they, "the Church cannot be where there is no
knowledge of Christ."<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">POLICY OF CHARLES.</div>

<p>Melancthon alone was still alarmed; he walked by sight
and not by faith, and, remembering the legate's smiles, he
had another interview with him, as early as the 4th August,
still demanding the cup for the laity, and lawful wives for
the priests. "Then," said he, "our pastors will place themselves
again under the government of bishops, and we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
be able to prevent those innumerable sects with which posterity
is threatened."<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> Melancthon's glance into the future
is remarkable: it does not, however, mean that he, like many
others, preferred a dead unity to a living diversity.</p>

<p>Campeggio, now certain of triumphing by the sword, disdainfully
handed this paper to Cochl&oelig;us, who hastened to refute
it. It is hard to say whether Melancthon or Campeggio
was the most infatuated. God did not permit an arrangement
that would have enslaved his Church.</p>

<p>Charles passed the whole of the 4th and the morning of
the 5th August in consultation with the Ultramontane party.
"It will never be by discussion that we shall come to an
understanding," said some; "and if the Protestants do not
submit voluntarily, it only remains for us to compel them."
They nevertheless decided, on account of the Refutation, to
adopt a middle course. During the whole of the diet,
Charles pursued a skilful policy. At first he refused everything,
hoping to lead away the princes by violence; then
he conceded a few unimportant points, under the impression
that the Protestants having lost all hope, would esteem so
much the more the little he yielded to them. This was what
he did again under the present circumstances. In the afternoon
of the 5th, the Count-palatine announced that the Emperor
would give them a copy of the Refutation, but on these conditions;
namely, that the Protestants should not reply, that
they should speedily agree with the Emperor, and that they
would not print or communicate to any one the Refutation
that should be confided to them.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></p>

<p>This communication excited murmurs among the Protestants.
"These conditions," said they all, "are inadmissible."&mdash;"The
Papists present us with their paper," added the
Chancellor Brück, "as the fox offered a thin broth to his
gossip the stork."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>

<p>"If the Refutation," continued he, "should come to be known
without our participation (and how can we prevent it?), we
shall be charged with it as a crime. Let us beware of accepting
so perfidious an offer.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> We already possess in the notes
of Camerarius several articles of this paper, and if we omit
any point, no one will have the right to reproach us with it."</p>

<p>On the next day (6th August) the Protestants declared to
the diet that they preferred declining the copy thus offered to
them, and appealed to God and to his Majesty.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> They thus
rejected all that the Emperor proposed to them, even what he
considered as a favour.</p>

<p>Agitation, anger, and affright, were manifested on every
branch of that august assembly.<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> This reply of the Evangelicals
was war&mdash;was rebellion. George of Saxony, the
Princes of Bavaria, all the violent adherents of Rome, trembled
with indignation; there was a sudden, an impetuous
movement, an explosion of murmurs and of hatred; and it
might have been feared that the two parties would have
come to blows in the very presence of the Emperor, if Archbishop
Albert, the Elector of Brandenburg, and the Dukes
of Brunswick, Pomerania, and Mecklenburg, rushing between
them, had not conjured the Protestants to put an end to this
deplorable combat, and not drive the Emperor to extremities.<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a>
The diet separated, their hearts filled with emotion, apprehension,
and trouble.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RESOLUTIONS OF THE CONSISTORY.</div>

<p>Never had the diet proposed such fatal alternatives. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
hopes of agreement, set forth in the edict of convocation, had
only been a deceitful lure: now the mask was thrown aside;
submission or the sword&mdash;such was the dilemma offered to
the Reformation. All announced that the day of tentatives
was passed, and that they were beginning one of violence.</p>

<p>In truth, on the 6th July, the Pope had assembled the consistory
of cardinals in his palace at Rome, and had made
known to them the Protestant ultimatum; namely, the cup
for the laity, the marriage of priests, the omission of the invocation
of saints in the sacrifice of the Mass, the use of ecclesiastical
property already secularized, and for the rest, the convocation
of a council. "These concessions," said the cardinals,
"are opposed to the religion, the discipline, and the
laws of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> We reject them, and vote our thanks to
the Emperor for the zeal which he employs in bringing back
the deserters." The Pope having thus decided, every attempt
at conciliation became useless.</p>

<p>Campeggio, on his side, redoubled in zeal. He spoke as
if in his person the Pope himself were present at Augsburg.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>
"Let the Emperor and the right-thinking princes form a
league," said he to Charles; "and if these rebels, equally
insensible to threats and promises, obstinately persist in their
diabolical course, then let his Majesty seize fire and sword,
let him take possession of all the property of the heretics, and
utterly eradicate these venomous plants.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> Then let him
appoint holy inquisitors, who shall go on the track of the
remnants of Reform, and proceed against them, as in Spain
against the Moors. Let him put the university of Wittemberg
under ban, burn the heretical books, and send back the
fugitive monks to their convents. But this plan must be
executed with courage."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">TWO MIRACLES.</div>

<p>Thus the jurisprudence of Rome consisted, according to a
prophecy uttered against the city which <i>is seated on seven
hills</i>, in adorning itself with pearls that it had stolen, and in
becoming drunk with the blood of the saints.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

<p>While Charles was thus urged on with blind fury by the
diet and the Pope, the Protestant princes, restrained by a
mute indignation, did not open their mouths,<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> and hence they
seemed to betray a weakness of which the Emperor was
eager to profit. But there was also strength concealed under
this weakness. "It only remains for us," exclaimed Melancthon,
"to embrace our Saviour's knees." In this they
laboured earnestly. Melancthon begged for Luther's prayers;
Brenz for those of his own church: a general cry of
distress and of faith ran through Evangelical Germany.
"You shall have sheep," said Brenz, "if you will send us
sheep: you know what I mean."<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> The sheep that were to
be offered in sacrifice were the prayers of the saints.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EMPEROR'S MENACE.</div>

<p>The Church was not wanting to itself. "Assembled every
day," wrote certain cities to the Electors, "we beg for you
strength, grace, and victory,&mdash;victory full of joy." But
the man of prayer and faith was especially Luther. A
calm and sublime courage, in which firmness shines at the
side of joy&mdash;a courage that rises and exults in proportion
as the danger increases&mdash;is what Luther's letters at this time
present in every line. The most poetical images are pale
beside those energetic expressions which issue in a boiling
torrent from the Reformer's soul. "I have recently witnessed
two miracles," wrote he on the 5th August to Chancellor
Brück; "this is the first. As I was at my window, I
saw the stars, and the sky, and that vast and magnificent
firmament in which the Lord has placed them. I could
nowhere discover the columns on which the Master has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
supported this immense vault, and yet the heavens did not
fall......</p>

<p>"And here is the second. I beheld thick clouds hanging
above us like a vast sea. I could neither perceive ground on
which they reposed, nor cords by which they were suspended;
and yet they did not fall upon us, but saluted us rapidly and
fled away.</p>

<p>"God," continued he, "will choose the manner, the time,
and the place suitable for deliverance, and he will not linger.
What the men of blood have begun, they have not yet
finished......Our rainbow is faint......their clouds are
threatening......the enemy comes against us with frightful
machines......But at last it will be seen to whom belonged
the ballistæ, and from what hands the javelins are launched.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>
It is no matter if Luther perishes: if Christ is conqueror,
Luther is conqueror also."<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a></p>

<p>Never had the Roman party, who did not know what was
the victory of faith, imagined themselves more certain of
success.</p>

<p>The doctors having refuted the Confession, the Protestants
ought, they imagined, to declare themselves convinced, and
all would then be restored to its ancient footing: such was
the Emperor's plan of campaign. He therefore urges and
calls upon the Protestants; but instead of submitting, they
announce a refutation of the Refutation. Upon this Charles
looked at his sword, and all the princes who surrounded him
did the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MASK.</div>

<p>John of Saxony understood what that meant, but he remained
firm. "The straight line," said he (the axiom was
familiar to him), "is the shortest road." It is this indomitable
firmness that has secured for him in history the name
of John the Persevering. He was not alone: all those Protestant
princes who had grown up in the midst of courts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
who were habituated to pay an humble obedience to the
Emperor, found at that time in their faith a noble independence
that confounded Charles the Fifth.</p>

<p>With the design of gaining the Marquis of Brandenburg,
they opened to him the possibility of according him some
possessions in Silesia on which he had claims. "If Christ
is Christ," replied he, "the doctrine that I have confessed
is truth."&mdash;"But do you know," quickly replied his cousin
the Elector Joachim, "what is your stake?"&mdash;"Certainly,"
replied the Margrave, "it is said I shall be expelled from
this country. Well! may God protect me!" One day
Prince Wolfgang of Anhalt met Doctor Eck. "Doctor,"
said he, "you are exciting to war, but you will find those
who will not be behindhand with you. I have broken many
a lance for my friends in my time. My Lord Jesus Christ
is assuredly worthy that I should do as much for him."</p>

<p>At the sight of this resolution, each one asked himself
whether Charles, instead of curing the disease, was not augmenting
it. Reflections, criticisms, jests, passed between the
citizens; and the good sense of the people manifested in its
own fashion what they thought of the folly of their chief.
We will adduce one instance.</p>

<p>It is said that one day, as the Emperor was at table with
many Roman-catholic princes, he was informed that some
comedians begged permission (according to custom) to amuse
their lordships. First appeared an old man wearing a mask,
and dressed in a doctor's robe, who advanced with difficulty
carrying a bundle of sticks in his arms, some straight and
some crooked. He approached the wide fireplace of the
Gothic hall, threw down his load in disorder, and immediately
withdrew.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> Charles and the courtiers read on his back the
inscription&mdash;<span class="smcap">John Reuchlin</span>. Then appeared another mask
with an intelligent look, who made every exertion to pair the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
straight and the crooked pieces;<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> but finding his labours
useless, he shook his head, turned to the door, and disappeared.
They read&mdash;<span class="smcap">Erasmus of Rotterdam</span>. Almost immediately
after advanced a monk with bright eye and decided gait, carrying
a brasier of lighted coals.<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> He put the wood in order,
set fire to it, blew and stirred it up, so that the flame rose
bright and sparkling into the air. He then retired, and on
his back were the words&mdash;<span class="smcap">Martin Luther</span>.</p>

<p>Next approached a magnificent personage, covered with
all the imperial insignia, who, seeing the fire so bright, drew
his sword, and endeavoured by violent thrusts to extinguish
it; but the more he struck, the fiercer burnt the flames, so
that at last he quitted the place in indignation. His name, as
it would seem, was not made known to the spectators, but all
divined it. The general attention was soon attracted by a new
character. A man, wearing a surplice and a mantle of red
velvet, with an alb of white wool that reached to his heels,
and having a stole around his neck, whose ends were ornamented
with pearls, advanced majestically. Beholding the
flames that already filled the hearth, he clapped his hands in
terror, and looking around him sought to find something to
extinguish them. He sees two vessels at the very extremity
of the hall, one filled with water, and the other with oil. He
rushes to them, seizes unwittingly on that containing the oil,
and throws it on the fire.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> The flames then spread with
such violence that the mask fled in alarm, raising his hands
to heaven; on his back was read the name of <span class="smcap">Leo X.</span></p>

<p>The mystery was finished; but instead of claiming their
remuneration, the pretended actors had disappeared. No one
asked the moral of this drama.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OMENS.</div>

<p>The lesson, however, proved useless; and the majority
of the diet, assuming at the same time the part assigned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the Emperor and the Pope, began to prepare the means necessary
for extinguishing the fire kindled by Luther. They negotiated
in Italy with the Duke of Mantua, who engaged to
send a few regiments of light cavalry across the Alps;<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> and
in England with Henry VIII., who had not forgotten Luther's
reply, and who promised Charles, through his ambassador,
an immense subsidy to destroy the heretics.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a></p>

<p>At the same time frightful prodigies announced the gloomy
future which threatened the Reform. At Spire fearful spectres,
having the shape of monks, with angry eyes and hasty
steps, had appeared during the night. "What do you want?"
they had been asked.&mdash;"We are going," they replied, "to
the Diet of Augsburg!" The circumstance had been carefully
investigated, and was found perfectly trustworthy.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>
"The interpretation is not difficult," exclaimed Melancthon:
"Evil spirits are coming to Augsburg to counteract our exertions,
and to destroy peace. They forebode horrible troubles
to us."<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> No one doubted this. "Everything is advancing
towards war," said Erasmus.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> "The diet will not terminate,"
wrote Brenz, "except by the destruction of all Germany."<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>
"There will be a slaughter of the saints," exclaimed
Bucer, "which will be such that the massacres of
Diocletian will scarcely come up to it."<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> War and blood!&mdash;this
was the general cry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TUMULT IN AUGSBURG.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>Suddenly, on the night of Saturday, 6th August, a great
disturbance broke out in the city of Augsburg.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> There was
running to and fro in the streets; messengers from the Emperor
were galloping in every direction; the senate was called
together and received an order to allow no one to pass the
gates of the city.<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> At the same time all were afoot in the
imperial barracks; the soldiers got ready their arms; the
regiments were drawn up, and at daybreak (about three
o'clock on Sunday morning) the Emperor's troops, in opposition
to the custom constantly followed in the diet, relieved
the soldiers of the city and took possession of the gates. At
the same time it was learnt that these gates would not be
opened, and that Charles had given orders to keep a strict
watch upon the Elector and his allies.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> A terrible awakening
for those who still flattered themselves with seeing the
religious debates conclude peacefully! Are not these unheard-of
measures the commencement of wars and the signal
of a frightful massacre?</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<div class="sidenote">TEMPTATION.</div>

<p>X. Trouble and anger prevailed in the imperial palace,
and it was the Landgrave who had caused them. Firm as
a rock in the midst of the tempest with which he was surrounded,
Philip of Hesse had never bent his head to the
blast. One day, in a public assembly, addressing the bishops,
he had said to them, "My lords, give peace to the Empire;
we beg it of you. If you will not do so, and if I must
fall, be sure that I will drag one or two of you with me."
They saw it was necessary to employ milder means with
him, and the Emperor endeavoured to gain him by showing a
favourable disposition with respect to the county of Katzenellenbogen,
about which he was at variance with the country
of Nassau, and to Wurtemberg, which he claimed for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
cousin Ulric. On his side Duke George of Saxony, his
father-in-law, had assured him that he would make him his
heir if he would submit to the Pope. "They carried him
to an exceeding high mountain, whence they showed him all
the kingdoms of the world and the glory thereof,"<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> says a
chronicler, but the Landgrave resisted the temptation.</p>

<p>One day he heard that the Emperor had manifested a desire
to speak to him. He leapt instantly on his horse and
appeared before Charles.<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> The latter, who had with him his
secretary Schweiss and the Bishop of Constance, represented
that he had four complaints against him; namely, of having
violated the Edict of Worms, of despising the Mass, of having,
during his absence, excited all kinds of revolt, and,
finally, of having transmitted to him a book in which his
sovereign rights were attacked. The Landgrave justified
himself; and the Emperor said that he accepted his replies,
except with regard to the faith, and begged him to show himself
in that respect entirely submissive to his majesty.
"What would you say," added Charles, in a winning tone,
"if I elevated you to the regal dignity?<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> But, if you show
yourself rebellious to my orders, then I shall behave as becomes
a Roman Emperor."</p>

<p>These words exasperated the Landgrave, but they did not
move him. "I am in the flower of my age," replied he,
"and I do not pretend to despise the joys of life and the
favour of the great; but to the deceitful goods of this world I
shall always prefer the ineffable grace of my God." Charles
was stupified; he could not understand Philip.</p>

<p>From this time the Landgrave had redoubled his exertions
to unite the adherents of Reform. The Zwinglian cities felt
that, whatever was the issue of the diet, they would be the
first victims, unless the Saxons should give them their hand.
But this there was some difficulty in obtaining.</p>

<div class="sidenote">UNION RESISTED.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>"It does not appear to me useful to the public weal, or
safe for the conscience," wrote Melancthon to Bucer, "to
load our princes with all the hatred your doctrine inspires."<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>
The Strasburgers replied, that the real cause of the Papists'
hatred was not so much the doctrine of the Eucharist as that
of justification by faith. "All we, who desire to belong to
Christ," said they, "are one, and we have nothing to expect
but death."<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a></p>

<p>This was true; but another motive besides checked Melancthon.
If all the Protestants united, they would feel their
strength, and war would be inevitable. Therefore, then, no
union!</p>

<p>The Landgrave, threatened by the Emperor, rejected by
the theologians, began to ask himself what he did at Augsburg.
The cup was full. Charles's refusal to communicate
the Romish Refutation, except on inadmissible conditions,
made it run over. Philip of Hesse saw but one course to
take&mdash;to quit the city.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the Emperor made known the conditions which
he placed on the communication of the reply, than on Friday
evening, 5th August, the Landgrave, going alone to the
Count-palatine, Charles's minister, had begged for an immediate
audience with his majesty. Charles, who did not care
about it, pretended to be busy, and had put off Philip until
the following Sunday.<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> But the latter answered that he could
not wait; that his wife, who was dangerously ill, entreated
him to return to Hesse without delay; and that, being one of
the youngest princes, the meanest in understanding, and useless
to Charles, he humbly begged his majesty would permit
him to leave on the morrow. The Emperor refused.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EMPEROR'S UNEASINESS.</div>

<p>We may well understand the storms this refusal excited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
in Philip's mind: but he knew how to contain himself;
never had he appeared more tranquil; during the whole of
Saturday (6th August), he seemed occupied only with a
magnificent tourney in honour of the Emperor and of his
brother Ferdinand.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> He prepared for it publicly; his servants
went to and fro, but under that din of horses and of
armour, Philip concealed very different designs. "The
Landgrave conducts himself with very great moderation,"
wrote Melancthon to Luther, the same day.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> "He told me
openly that, to preserve peace, he would submit to conditions
still harder than those which the Emperor imposes on us, and
whatever he could accept without dishonouring the Gospel,
he would do so."</p>

<p>Yet Charles was not at ease. The Landgrave's demand
pursued him; all the Protestants might do the same, and
even quit Augsburg unexpectedly. The clue, that he had
hitherto so skilfully held in his hands, was perhaps about
to be broken: it was better to be violent than ridiculous.
The Emperor therefore resolved on striking a decisive blow.
The Elector, the princes, the deputies, are still in Augsburg:
he must at every risk prevent them from leaving it. Such
were the heavy thoughts that on the night of the 6th August,
while the Protestants were calmly sleeping,<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> banished repose
from Charles's eyes; and which made him hastily
arouse the councillors of Augsburg, and send his messengers
and soldiers through the streets of the city.</p>

<p>The Protestant princes were still slumbering, when they
received, on the part of the Emperor, the unexpected order
to repair immediately to the Hall of the Chapter.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PROTESTANT FIRMNESS.</div>

<p>It was eight o'clock when they arrived. They found there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the electors of Brandenburg and Mentz, the Dukes of Saxony,
Brunswick, and Mecklenburg, the Bishops of Salzburg,
Spire, and Strasburg, George Truchses, the Margrave of
Baden's representative, Count Martin of (OE)lting, the Abbot
of Weingarten, and the Provost of Bamberg. These were
the commissioners nominated by Charles to terminate this
great affair.</p>

<p>It was the most decided among them, Joachim of Brandenburg,
who began to speak. "You know," said he to
the Protestants, "with what mildness the Emperor has endeavoured
to re-establish unity. If some abuses have crept
into the Christian Church, he is ready to correct them, in
conjunction with the Pope. But how contrary to the Gospel
are the sentiments you have adopted! Abandon then
your errors, do not any longer remain separate from the
Church, and sign the Refutation without delay.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> If you
refuse, then through your fault how many souls will be lost,
how much blood shed, what countries laid waste, what
trouble in all the Empire! And you," said he, turning towards
the Elector, "your electorate, your life, all will be torn
from you, and certain ruin will fall upon your subjects, and
even upon their wives and children."</p>

<p>The Elector remained motionless. At any time this language
would have been alarming: it was still more so now
that the city was almost in a state of siege. "We now understand,"
said the Protestants to one another, "why the imperial
guards occupy the gates of the city."<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> It was evident,
indeed, that the Emperor intended violence.<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PHILIP OF HESSE.</div>

<p>The Protestants are unanimous: surrounded with soldiers,
at the very gates of the prison, and beneath the thousand
swords of Charles, they will remain firm. All these threats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
will not make them take one step backwards.<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> It was important
for them, however, to consider their reply. They begged
for a few minutes' delay, and retired.</p>

<p>To submit voluntarily, or to be reduced by force, such was
the dilemma Charles proposed to the Evangelical Christians.</p>

<p>At the moment when each was anxious about the issue of
this struggle, in which the destinies of Christianity were contending,
an alarming rumour suddenly raised the agitation
of all minds to its height.</p>

<p>The Landgrave, in the midst of his preparations for the
tournament, meditated the most serious resolution. Excluded
by Charles from every important deliberation, irritated at the
treatment the Protestants had undergone during this diet,<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a>
convinced that they had no more chance of peace,<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> not doubting
that their liberty was greatly endangered in Augsburg,
and feeling unable to conceal under the appearance of moderation
the indignation with which his soul was filled, being
besides of a quick, prompt, and resolute character, Philip
had decided on quitting the city and repairing to his states, in
order to act freely, and to serve as a support to the Reform.</p>

<p>But what mystery was required! If the Landgrave was
taken in the act, no doubt he would be put under arrest. This
daring step might therefore become the signal of those extreme
measures from which he longed to escape.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FLIGHT FROM AUGSBURG.</div>

<p>It was Saturday, the 6th August, the day for which Philip
had requested the Emperor's leave of absence. He waits
until the commencement of the night, and then, about eight
o'clock, disguised in a foreign dress, without bidding farewell
to any of his friends,<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> and taking every imaginable precaution,<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>
he makes for the gates of the city, about the time
when they are usually closed. Five or six cavaliers followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
him singly, and at a little distance.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> In so critical a moment
will not these men-at-arms attract attention? Philip traverses
the streets without danger, approaches the gate,<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> passes with
a careless air through the midst of the guard, between the
scattered soldiers; no one moves, all remain idly seated, as
if nothing extraordinary was going on. Philip has passed
without being recognised.<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> His five or six horsemen come
through in like manner. Behold them all at last in the open
country. The little troop immediately spur their horses, and
flee with headlong speed far from the walls of the imperial
city.</p>

<p>Yet Philip has taken his measures so well, that no one as
yet suspects his departure. When during the night Charles
occupies the gates with his own guards, he thinks the Landgrave
still in the city.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> When the Protestants were assembled
at eight in the morning in the Chapter-hall, the princes
of both parties were a little astonished at the absence of Philip
of Hesse. They are accustomed, however, to see him keep
aloof; he is in a pet, no doubt. No one imagines he is between
twelve and fifteen leagues from Augsburg.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ALARM IN AUGSBURG.</div>

<p>After the termination of the conference, and as each one was
returning towards his hotel, the Elector of Brandenburg
and his friends on the one hand, elated at the speech they
had delivered, the Elector of Saxony and his allies on the
other, resolved to sacrifice everything, inquiries were made
at the Landgrave's lodgings as to the reason of his absence;
they closely question Salz, Nuszbicker, Mayer, and Schnepf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
At last the Hessian councillors can no longer keep the secret.
"The Landgrave," said they, "has returned to
Hesse."</p>

<p>This news circulated immediately through all the city,
and shook it like the explosion of a mine. Charles especially,
who found himself mocked, and frustrated in his expectations&mdash;Charles,
who had not the least suspicion,<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> trembled,
and was enraged.<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> The Protestants, whom the Landgrave
had not admitted to his secret,<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> are as much astonished
as the Roman-catholics themselves, and fear that this
inconsiderate departure may be the immediate signal for a
terrible persecution. There was only Luther, who, the moment
he heard of Philip's proceeding, highly approved of it,
and exclaimed: "Of a truth all these delays and indignities
are enough to fatigue more than one Landgrave."<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a></p>

<p>The Chancellor of Hesse gave the Elector of Saxony a
letter that his master had left for him. Philip spoke in this
ostensible document of his wife's health; but he had charged
his ministers to inform the Elector in private of the real
causes of his departure. He announced, moreover, that he
had given orders to his ministers to assist the Protestants in
all things, and exhort his allies to permit themselves in no
manner to be turned aside from the Word of God.<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> "As
for me," said he, "I shall fight for the Word of God, at the
risk of my goods, my states, my subjects, and my life."</p>

<div class="sidenote">METAMORPHOSIS.</div>

<p>The effect of the Landgrave's departure was instantaneous:
a real revolution was then effected in the diet. The Elector
of Mentz and the bishops of Franconia, Philip's near neighbours,
imagined they already saw him on their frontiers at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
head of a powerful army, and they replied to the Archbishop
of Salzburg, who expressed astonishment at their
alarm: "Ah! if you were in our place you would do the
same." Ferdinand, knowing the intimate relations of Philip
with the Duke of Wurtemberg, trembled for the estates of
this prince, at that time usurped by Austria; and Charles
the Fifth, undeceived with regard to those princes whom he
had believed so timid, and whom he had treated with so much
arrogance, had no doubt that this sudden fit of Philip's had
been maturely deliberated in the common council of the
Protestants. All saw a declaration of war in the Landgrave's
sudden departure. They called to mind that at the moment
when they thought the least about it, they might see him
appear at the head of his soldiers, on the frontiers of his
enemies, and no one was ready; no one even wished to be
ready! A thunderbolt had fallen in the midst of the diet.
They repeated the news to one another, with troubled eyes
and affrighted looks. All was confusion in Augsburg; and
couriers bore afar, in every direction, astonishment and
consternation.</p>

<p>This alarm immediately converted the enemies of the Reform.
The violence of Charles and of the princes was broken
in this memorable night as if by enchantment; and the furious
wolves were suddenly transformed into meek and docile
lambs.<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">UNUSUAL MODERATION.</div>

<p>It was still Sunday morning: Charles the Fifth immediately
convoked the diet for the afternoon.<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> "The Landgrave
has quitted Augsburg," said Count Frederick from the
Emperor; "his majesty flatters himself that even the friends
of that prince were ignorant of his departure. It was without
the Emperor's knowledge, and even in defiance of his
express prohibition, that Philip of Hesse has left, thus failing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
in all his duties. He has wished to put the diet out of joint.<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a>
But the Emperor conjures you not to permit yourselves to be
led astray by him, and to contribute rather to the happy issue
of this national assembly. His majesty's gratitude will thus
be secured to you."</p>

<p>The Protestants replied, that the departure of the Landgrave
had taken place without their knowledge; that they
had heard of it with pain, and that they would have dissuaded
him. Nevertheless they did not doubt that this prince
had solid reasons for such a step; besides he had left his
councillors with full powers, and that, as for them, they were
ready to do everything to conclude the diet in a becoming
manner. Then, confident in their rights, and decided to resist
Charles's arbitrary acts, they continued: "It is pretended
that the gates were closed on our account. We beg your
majesty to revoke this order, and to prevent any similar orders
being given for the future."</p>

<p>Never was Charles the Fifth less at ease: he had just
spoken as a father, and they remind him that a few hours
back he had acted like a tyrant. Some subterfuge was requisite.
"It is not on your account," replied the Count-palatine,
"that the Emperor's soldiers occupy the gates......Beware
of believing those who tell you so......Yesterday
there was a quarrel between two soldiers,<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> and a mob was
collected......This is why the Emperor took that step.
Besides, such things shall not be done again without the Elector
of Saxony, in his quality of marshal of the Empire, being
first informed of them." An order was given immediately
to reopen the gates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PEACE! PEACE!</div>

<p>No exertions were now spared by the Roman party to convince
the Protestants of their good-will: there was an unaccustomed
mildness in the language of the Count-palatine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
in the looks of Charles.<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> The princes of the Papal party,
once so terrible, were similarly transformed. They had
been hastily forced to speak out; if they desired war, they
must begin it instantly.</p>

<p>But they shrunk back at this frightful prospect. How,
with the enthusiasm that animated the Protestants, take up
arms against them! Were not the abuses of the Church
everywhere acknowledged, and could the Roman princes be
sure of their own subjects? Besides, what would be the
issue of a war but the increase of the Emperor's power?
The Roman-catholic states, and the Duke of Bavaria in particular,
would have been glad to see Charles at war with the
Protestants, in the hope that he would thus consume his
strength; but it was, on the contrary, with their own soldiers
that the Emperor designed attacking the heretics. Henceforth
they rejected the instrumentality of arms as eagerly as
they had at first desired it.</p>

<p>Everything had thus changed in Augsburg: the Romish
party was paralyzed, disheartened, and even broken up. The
sword already drawn was hastily thrust back into the sheath.
Peace! peace! was the cry of all.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>XI. The diet now entered upon its third phasis, and as the
time of tentatives had been followed by that of menaces;
now that of arrangements was to succeed the period of menaces.
New and more formidable dangers were then to be
encountered by the Reform. Rome, seeing the sword torn
from its hands, had seized the net, and enlacing her adversaries
with "cords of humanity and bands of love," was
endeavouring to drag them gently into the abyss.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MIXED COMMISSION.</div>

<p>At eight o'clock in the morning of the 16th August, a
mixed commission was framed, which counted on each side
two princes, two lawyers, and three theologians. In the
Romish party, there were Duke Henry of Brunswick, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Bishop of Augsburg, the Chancellors of Baden and Cologne,
with Eck, Cochl&oelig;us, and Wimpina; on the part of the Protestants,
were the Margrave George of Brandenburg, the
Prince Electoral of Saxony, the Chancellors Brück and Heller,
with Melancthon, Brenz, and Schnepf.<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>

<p>They agreed to take as basis the Confession of the Evangelical
states, and they began to read it article by article.
The Romish theologians displayed an unexpected condescension.
Out of twenty-one dogmatical articles, there were
only six or seven to which they made any objection. Original
Sin stopped them some time: at length they came to an
understanding; the Protestants admitted that Baptism removed
the guilt of the sin, and the Papists agreed that it did
not wash away concupiscence. As for the Church, they
granted that it contained sanctified men and sinners; they
coincided also on confession. The Protestants rejected especially
as impossible the enumeration of all the sins prescribed
by Rome. Doctor Eck yielded this point.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a></p>

<p>There remained three doctrines only on which they differed.</p>

<p>The first was that of Penance. The Romish doctors taught
that it contained three parts: contrition, confession, and satisfaction.
The Protestants rejected the latter, and the Romanists
clearly perceiving that with satisfaction would fall indulgences,
purgatory, with other of their doctrines and profits,
vigorously maintained it. "We agree," said they, "that the
penance imposed by the priest does not procure remission of
the guilt of sin: but we maintain that it is necessary to obtain
remission of the penalty."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROMISH DISSIMULATION.</div>

<p>The second controverted point was the Invocation of Saints;
and the third, and principal one, was Justification by Faith.
It was of the greatest importance for the Romanists to maintain
the meritorious influence of works: all their system, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
reality, was based on that. Eck therefore haughtily declared
war on the assertion that faith alone justifies. "That word
<i>sole</i>," said he, "we cannot tolerate. It generates scandals,
and renders men brutal and impious. Let us send back the
<i>sole</i> to the cobbler."<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a></p>

<p>But the Protestants would not listen to such reasoning; and
even when they put the question to each other, Shall we maintain
that faith alone justifies us gratuitously? "Undoubtedly,
undoubtedly," exclaimed one of them with exaggeration,
"<i>gratuitously and uselessly</i>."<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> They even adduced strange
authorities: "Plato," said they, "declares that it is not by
external works, but by virtue that God is adored; and every
one knows these verses of Cato's:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Si deus est animus, nobis ut carmina dicunt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hic tibi precipue pura sit mente colendus."<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Certainly," resumed the Romish theologians; "it is only
of works performed with grace that we speak; but we say that
in such works there is something meritorious." The Protestants
declared they could not grant it.</p>

<p>They had approximated however beyond all hope. The
Roman theologians, clearly understanding their position, had
purposed to appear agreed rather than be so in reality. Every
one knew, for instance, that the Protestants rejected transubstantiation:
but the Article of the Confession on this point,
being able to be taken in the Romish sense, the Papists had
admitted it. Their triumph was only deferred. The general
expressions that were used in all the controverted points,
would permit somewhat later a Romish interpretation to be
given to the Confession; ecclesiastical authority would declare
this the only true one; and Rome, thanks to a few moments of
dissimulation, would thus reascend the throne. Have we not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
seen in our own days the Thirty-nine Articles of the Anglican
Church interpreted in accordance with the Council of
Trent? There are causes in which falsehood is never awanting.
This plot was as skilfully executed, as it was profoundly
conceived.</p>

<p>The Commissioners were on the best terms with one
another, and concord seemed restored. One single uneasiness
disturbed that happy moment: the idea of the Landgrave:
"Ignorant that we are almost agreed," said they, "this young
mad-brain is doubtless already assembling his army; we must
bring him back, and make him a witness of our cordial
union." On the morning of the 13th, one of the members of
the Commission (Duke Henry of Brunswick), accompanied by
a councillor of the Emperor, set out to discharge this difficult
mission.<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> Duke George of Saxony supplied his place as arbitrator.</p>

<p>They now passed from the first part of the Confession to the
second: from doctrines to abuses. Here the Romish theologians
could not yield so easily, for if they appeared to
agree with the Protestants, it was all over with the honour
and power of the hierarchy. It was accordingly for this
period of the combat that they had reserved their cunning
and their strength.</p>

<p>They began by approaching the Protestants as near as
they could, for the more they granted, the more they might
draw the Reform to them and stifle it. "We think," said
they, "that with the permission of his holiness, and the approbation
of his majesty, we shall be able to permit, until
the next council, the communion in both kinds, wherever it is
practised already; only, your ministers should preach at
Easter, that that is not of Divine institution, and that Christ
is wholly in each kind.<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MAIN QUESTION.</div>

<p>"Moreover," continued they, "as for the married priests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
desirous of sparing the poor women whom they have seduced,
of providing for the maintenance of their innocent children,
and of preventing every kind of scandal, we will tolerate
them until the next council, and we shall then see if it will
not be right to decree that married men may be admitted to
holy orders, as was the case in the primitive Church for
many centuries.<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a></p>

<p>"Finally, we acknowledge that the sacrifice of the Mass
is a mystery, a representation, a sacrifice of commemoration,
a memorial of the sufferings and death of Christ, accomplished
on the cross."<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a></p>

<p>This was yielding much: but the turn of the Protestants
was come; for if Rome appeared to give, it was only to
take in return.</p>

<p>The grand question was the Church, its maintenance and
government: who should provide for it? They could see
only two means: princes or bishops. If they feared the
bishops, they must decide for the princes: if they feared the
princes, they must decide for the bishops. They were at
that time too distant from the normal state to discover a third
solution, and to perceive that the Church ought to be maintained
by the Church itself&mdash;by the christian people.
"Secular princes in the long-run will be defaulters to the
government of the Church," said the Saxon divines in the
opinion they presented on the 18th August; "they are not
fit to execute it, and besides it would cost them too dear:<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>
the bishops, on the contrary, have property destined to provide
for this charge."</p>

<p>Thus the presumed incapacity of the state, and the fear
they entertained of its indifference, threw the Protestants into
the arms of the hierarchy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHURCH GOVERNMENT.</div>

<p>They proposed therefore to restore to the bishops their jurisdiction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the maintenance of discipline, and the superintendence
of the priests, provided they did not persecute the Evangelical
doctrine, and did not oppress the pastors with impious
vows and burdens. "We may not," added they, "without
strong reasons rend that order by which the bishops are over
the priests, and which existed in the Church from the beginning.
It is dangerous before the Lord to change the order of
governments." Their argument is not founded upon the Bible,
as may be seen, but upon ecclesiastical discipline.</p>

<p>The Protestant divines went even farther, and, taking a
last step that seemed decisive, they consented to acknowledge
the Pope as being (but of human right) supreme bishop of
Christendom. "Although the Pope is Anti-christ, we may
be under his government, as the Jews were under Pharaoh,
and in later days under Caiaphas." We must confess these
two comparisons were not flattering to the Pope. "Only,"
added the doctors, "let the sound doctrine be fully accorded
to us."</p>

<p>The chancellor Brück alone appears to have been conscious
of the truth: he wrote on the margin with a firm hand:
"We cannot acknowledge the Pope, because we say he is
Antichrist, and because he claims the primacy of right
divine."<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a></p>

<p>Finally, the Protestant theologians consented to agree with
Rome as regards indifferent ceremonies, fasts, and forms of
worship; and the Elector engaged to put under sequestration
the ecclesiastical property already secularized, until the decision
of the next council.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRETENDED CONCORD.</div>

<p>Never was the conservative spirit of Lutheranism more
clearly manifested. "We have promised our adversaries to
concede to them certain points of church government, that
may be granted without wounding the conscience," wrote
Melancthon.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> But he began to be very doubtful whether
ecclesiastical concessions would not drag with them doctrinal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
concessions also. The reform was drifting away......still
a few more fathoms, and it was lost. Already disunion,
trouble, and affright began to spread among its ranks. Melancthon
has become more childish than a child, said one of
his friends;<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> and yet he was so excited, that the Chancellor
of Lunenburg having made some objections to these
unprecedented concessions, the little Master of Arts proudly
raised his head, and said with a sharp and harsh tone of
voice: "He who dares assert that the means indicated are
not christian is a liar and a scoundrel."<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> On which the
Chancellor immediately repaid him in his own coin. These
expressions cannot, however, detract from Melancthon's reputation
for mildness. After so many useless efforts, he was
exhausted, irritated, and his words cut the deeper, as they
were the less expected from him. He was not the only one
demoralized. Brenz appeared clumsy, rude, and uncivil;
Chancellor Keller had misled the pious Margrave of Brandenburg,
and transformed the courage of this prince into
pusillanimity: no other human support remained to the
Elector than his chancellor Brück. And even this firm man
began to grow alarmed at his isolation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S LETTERS.</div>

<p>But he was not alone: the most earnest protests were received
from without. "If it is true that you are making
such concessions," said their affrighted friends to the Saxon
divines, "christian liberty is at an end.<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> What is your
pretended concord? a thick cloud that you raise in the air
to eclipse the sun that was beginning to illumine the Church.<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a>
Never will the christian people accept conditions so opposed
to the Word of God; and your only gain will be furnishing
the enemies of the Gospel with a specious pretext to butcher
those who remain faithful to it." Among the laymen these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
convictions were general. "Better die with Jesus Christ,"
said all Augsburg,<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> "than gain the favour of the whole world
without him!"</p>

<p>No one felt so much alarm as Luther at the moment when
he saw the glorious edifice that God had raised by his hands
on the point of falling to ruin in those of Melancthon. The
day on which this news arrived, he wrote five letters,&mdash;to
the Elector, to Melancthon, to Spalatin, to Jonas, and to Brenz,
all equally filled with courage and with faith.</p>

<p>"I learn," said he, "that you have begun a marvellous
work, namely, to put Luther and the Pope in harmony; but
the Pope is unwilling, and Luther begs to be excused.<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> And
if, in despite of them, you succeed in this affair, then after
your example I will bring together Christ and Belial.</p>

<p>"The world I know is full of wranglers who obscure the
doctrine of justification by faith, and of fanatics who persecute
it. Do not be astonished at it, but continue to defend it
with courage, for it is the heel of the seed of the woman that
shall bruise the head of the serpent.<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a></p>

<p>"Beware also of the jurisdiction of the bishops, for fear we
should have soon to recommence a more terrible struggle than
the first. They will take our concessions widely, very widely,
always more widely, and will give us theirs narrowly, very
narrowly, and always more narrowly.<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> All these negotiations
are impossible, unless the Pope should renounce his
Papacy.</p>

<p>"A pretty motive indeed our adversaries assign! They
cannot, say they, restrain their subjects, if we do not publish
everywhere that they have the truth for them: as if God only
taught his Word, in order that our enemies might at pleasure
tyrannize over their people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WORD ABOVE THE CHURCH.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>"They cry out that we condemn all the Church. No,
we do not condemn it; but as for them, they condemn all
the Word of God, and the Word of God is more than the
Church."<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a></p>

<p>This important declaration of the Reformers decides the
controversy between the Evangelical Christians and the Papacy:
unfortunately we have often seen Protestants return,
on this fundamental point, to the error of Rome, and set the
visible Church above the Word of God.</p>

<p>"I write to you now," continues Luther, "to believe with
all of us (and that through obedience to Jesus Christ), that
Campeggio is a famous demon.<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> I cannot tell how violently
these conditions agitate me which you propose. The plan of
Campeggio and the Pope has been to try us first by threats,
and then, if they do not succeed, by stratagems; you have
triumphed over the first attack, and sustained the terrible
coming of Cæsar: now, then, for the second. Act with
courage, and do not yield to the adversaries except what can
be proved with evidence from the very Word of God.</p>

<p>"But if, which Christ forbid! you do not put forward all
the Gospel; if, on the contrary, you shut up that glorious
eagle in a sack; Luther&mdash;doubt it not!&mdash;Luther will come
and gloriously deliver the eagle.<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> As certainly as Christ
lives, that shall be done!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">PAPIST INFATUATION.</div>

<p>Thus spoke Luther, but in vain: everything in Augsburg
was tending towards approaching ruin; Melancthon
had a bandage over his eyes that nothing could tear off. He
no longer listened to Luther, and cared not for popularity.
"It does not become us," said he, "to be moved by the
clamours of the vulgar:<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> we must think of peace and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
posterity. If we repeal the episcopal jurisdiction, what will
be the consequence to our descendants? The secular powers
care nothing about the interests of religion.<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> Besides too
much dissimilarity in the Churches is injurious to peace: we
must unite with the bishops, lest the infamy of schism should
overwhelm us for ever."<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a></p>

<p>They too readily listened to Melancthon, and they vigorously
laboured to bind to the Papacy by the bonds of the
hierarchy the Church that God had wonderfully emancipated.
Protestantism rushed blindfold into the nets of its enemies.
Already serious voices announced the return of the Lutherans
into the bosom of the Romish Church. "They are
preparing their defection, and are passing over to the Papists,"
said Zwingle.<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> The politic Charles the Fifth so
acted that no haughty word should compromise the victory;
but the Roman clergy could not master themselves: their
pride, their insolence increased every day. "One would never
believe," said Melancthon, "the airs of triumph which the
Papists give themselves." There was good reason! the
agreement was on the verge of conclusion: yet one or two
steps.......and then, woe to Reform!</p>

<p>Who could prevent this desolating ruin? It was Luther
who pronounced the name towards which all eyes should be
turned: "Christ lives," said he, "and he by whom the
violence of our enemies has been conquered will give us
strength to surmount their wiles." This was in truth the
only resource, and it did not fail the Reform.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A NEW COMMISSION.</div>

<p>If the Roman hierarchy had been willing, under certain
admissible conditions, to receive the Protestants who were
ready to capitulate, it was all over with them. When once
it held them in its arms, it would have stifled them; but God
blinded the Papacy, and thus saved his Church. "No concessions,"
had declared the Romish senate; and Campeggio,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
elated with his victory, repeated, "No concessions!"
He moved heaven and earth to inflame the Catholic zeal of
Charles in this decisive moment. From the Emperor he
passed to the princes. "Celibacy, confession, the withdrawal
of the cup, private masses!" exclaimed he: "all these
are obligatory: we must have all." This was saying to the
Evangelical Christians, as the Samnites to the ancient Romans:
"Here are the Caudine Forks: pass through them!"</p>

<p>The Protestants saw the yoke, and shuddered. God revived
the courage of the confessors in their weakened hearts.
They raised their heads, and rejected this humiliating capitulation.
The commission was immediately dissolved.</p>

<p>This was a great deliverance; but soon appeared a fresh
danger. The Evangelical Christians should have immediately
quitted Augsburg; but, said one of them,<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> "Satan,
disguised as an angel of light, blinded the eyes of their understanding."
They remained.</p>

<p>All was not yet lost for Rome, and the spirit of falsehood
and of cunning might again renew its attacks.</p>

<p>It was believed at court that this disagreeable termination
of the commission was to be ascribed to some wrong-headed
individuals, and particularly to Duke George. They therefore
resolved to name another, composed of six members only: on
the one side, Eck, with the chancellors of Cologne and Baden;
on the other, Melancthon, with the chancellors Brück and
Heller. The Protestants consented, and all was begun
anew.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LANDGRAVE'S FIRMNESS.</div>

<p>The alarm then increased among the most decided followers
of the Reformation. "If we expose ourselves unceasingly
to new dangers, must we not succumb at last?"<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> The
deputies of Nuremberg in particular declared that their city
would never place itself again under the detested yoke of the
bishops. "It is the advice of the undecided Erasmus that
Melancthon follows," said they. "Say rather of Ahithophel"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
(2 Sam. xv.), replied others. "However it may be," added
they; "if the Pope had bought Melancthon, the latter could
have done nothing better to secure the victory for him."<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a></p>

<p>The Landgrave was especially indignant at this cowardice.
"Melancthon," wrote he to Zwingle, "walks backwards like
a crab."<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> From Friedwald, whither he had repaired after
his flight from Augsburg, Philip of Hesse endeavoured to
check the fall of Protestantism. "When we begin to yield, we
always yield more," wrote he to his ministers at Augsburg.
"Declare therefore to my allies that I reject these perfidious
conciliations. If we are Christians, what we should pursue
is, not our own advantage, but the consolation of so many
weary and afflicted consciences, for whom there is no salvation
if we take away the Word of God. The bishops are not
real bishops, for they speak not according to the Holy Scriptures.
If we acknowledge them, what would happen? They
would remove our ministers, oppress the Gospel, re-establish
ancient abuses, and the last state would be worse than the
first. If the Papists will permit the free preaching of the pure
Gospel, let us come to an understanding with them; for the
truth will be the strongest, and will root out all the rest. But
if not!&mdash;No. This is the moment, not to yield, but to remain
firm even to the death. Baffle these fearful combinations of
Melancthon, and tell, from me, the deputies of the cities to be
men, and not women.<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> Let us fear nothing: God is with
us."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TWO PHANTOMS.</div>

<p>Melancthon and his friends, thus attacked, sought to justify
themselves: on the one hand, they maintained, that if
they preserved the doctrine it would finally overthrow the
hierarchy. But then why restore it? Was it not more than
doubtful whether a doctrine so enfeebled would still retain
strength sufficient to shake the Papacy? On the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Melancthon and his friends pointed out two phantoms before
which they shrunk in affright. The first was <i>war</i>: it was,
in their opinion, imminent. "It is not only," said they,
"numberless temporal evils that it will bring with it,&mdash;the
devastation of Germany, murder, violation, sacrilege, rapine;
but it will produce spiritual evils more frightful still, and
will inevitably bring on the perturbation of all religion."<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a>
The second phantom was the supremacy of the state. Melancthon
and his friends foresaw the dependence to which
the princes would reduce the Church, the increasing secularization
of its institutions and of its instruments, the spiritual
death that would result, and they shrunk back with terror
from the frightful prospect. "Good men do not think that
the court should regulate the ministry of the Church,"<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> said
Brenz. "Have you not yourselves experienced," added he
ironically, "with what wisdom and mildness these boors ('tis
thus I denominate the officials and prefects of the princes)
treat the ministers of the Church, and the Church itself.
Rather die seven times!"&mdash;"I see," exclaimed Melancthon,
"what a Church we shall have if the ecclesiastical government
is abolished. I discover in the future a tyranny far more
intolerable than that which has existed to this day."<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> Then,
bowed down by the accusations that poured upon him from
every side, the unhappy Philip exclaimed: "If it is I who
have aroused this tempest, I pray his majesty to throw me,
like Jonas, into the sea, and to drag me out only to give me
up to torture and to the stake."<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ROME AND CHRISTIANITY.</div>

<p>The Romish episcopacy once recognised, all seemed easy.
In the Commission of Six, they conceded the cup to the laity,
marriage to the pastors, and the article of prayer to saints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
appeared of little importance. But they stopped at three
doctrines which the Evangelicals could not yield. The first
was the necessity of human satisfaction for the remission of
the penalties of sin; the second, the idea of something meritorious
in every good work; the third, the utility of private
masses. "Ah!" quickly replied Campeggio to Charles the
Fifth, "I would rather be cut in pieces than concede anything
about Masses."<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a></p>

<p>"What!" replied the politicians, "when you agree on all
the great doctrines of salvation, will you for ever rend the
unity of the Church for three such trivial articles? Let
the theologians make a last effort, and we shall see the two
parties unite, and Rome embrace Wittemberg."</p>

<div class="sidenote">IRRITATION.</div>

<p>It was not so: under these three points was concealed a
whole system. On the Roman side, they entertained the
idea that certain works gain the Divine favour, independently
of the disposition of him who performs them, and by virtue
of the will of the Church. On the Evangelical side, on the
contrary, they felt a conviction that these external ordinances
were mere human traditions, and that the only thing which
procured man the Divine favour was the work that God accomplished
by Christ on the cross; while the only thing that
put him in possession of this favour was the work of regeneration
that Christ accomplishes by his Spirit in the heart
of the sinner. The Romanists, by maintaining their three
articles, said: "the Church saves," which is the essential
doctrine of Rome; the Evangelicals, by rejecting them, said:
"Jesus Christ alone saves," which is Christianity itself. This
is the great antithesis which then existed, and which still
separates the two Churches. With these three points, which
placed souls under her dependence, Rome justly expected
to recover everything; and she showed by her perseverance
that she understood her position. But the Evangelicals were
not disposed to abandon theirs. The Christian principle
was maintained against the ecclesiastical principle which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
aspired to swallow it up: Jesus Christ stood firm in presence
of the Church, and it was seen that henceforward all
conferences were superfluous.</p>

<p>Time pressed: for two months and a half Charles the Fifth
had been labouring in Augsburg, and his pride suffered because
four or five theologians checked the triumphal progress
of the conqueror of Pavia. "What!" said they to him, "a
few days sufficed to overthrow the King of France and the
Pope, and you cannot succeed with these Gospellers!" They
determined on breaking off the conferences. Eck, irritated
because neither stratagem nor terror had been effectual, could
not master himself in the presence of the Protestants.
"Ah!" exclaimed he, at the moment of separation, "why
did not the Emperor, when he entered Germany, make a
general inquest about the Lutherans? He would then have
heard arrogant answers, witnessed monsters of heresy, and
his zeal suddenly taking fire, would have led him to destroy
all this faction.<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> But now Brück's mild language and Melancthon's
concessions prevent him from getting so angry as
the cause requires." Eck said these words with a smile;
but they expressed all his thoughts. The colloquy terminated
on the 30th of August.</p>

<p>The Romish states made their report to the Emperor. They
were face to face, three steps only from each other, without
either side being able to approach nearer, even by a hair's
breadth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GORDIAN KNOT.</div>

<p>Thus, then, Melancthon had failed; and his enormous
concessions were found useless. From a false love of peace,
he had set his heart on an impossibility. Melancthon was
at the bottom a really Christian soul. God preserved him
from his great weakness, and broke the clue that was about
to lead him to destruction. Nothing could have been more
fortunate for the Reformation than Melancthon's failure; but
nothing could, at the same time, have been more fortunate for
himself: his friends saw that though he was willing to yield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
much, he could not go so far as to yield Christ himself, and
his defeat justified him in the eyes of the Protestants.</p>

<p>The Elector of Saxony and the Margrave of Brandenburg
sent to beg Charles's leave to depart. The latter refused at
first rather rudely, but at last he began to conjure the princes
not to create by their departure new obstacles to the arrangements
they soon hoped to be able to conclude.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> We shall
see of what nature these arrangements were.</p>

<p>They appeared to redouble their exertions. If they now
let the clue slip, it is lost for ever: they laboured accordingly
to reunite the two ends. There were conferences in the gardens,
conferences at the churches, at St. George's, at St.
Maurice's, between the Duke of Brunswick and John Frederick
the Elector's son, the Chancellors of Baden and of Saxony,
the Chancellor of Liege and Melancthon; but all these attempts
were unavailing. It was to other means they were going to
have recourse.</p>

<p>Charles the Fifth had resolved to take the affair in hand, and
to cut the Gordian knot, which neither doctor nor princes could
untie. Irritated at seeing his advances spurned and his
authority compromised, he thought that the moment was
come for drawing the sword. On the 4th September the
members of the Roman party, who were still endeavouring to
gain over the Protestants, whispered these frightful intentions
in Melancthon's ears. "We scarcely dare mention it," said
they: "the sword is already in the Emperor's hands, and
certain people exasperate him more and more. He is not
easily enraged, but once angry it is impossible to quiet
him."<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ALARM IN ROME.</div>

<p>Charles had reason to appear exacting and terrible. He
had at length obtained from Rome an unexpected concession&mdash;a
council. Clement VII. had laid the Emperor's request
before a Congregation: "How will men who reject the ancient
councils submit to a new one?" they had replied. Clement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
himself had no wish for such an assembly. His birth
and his conduct made him equally dread it.<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> However, his
promises at the Castle of St. Angelo and at Bologna rendered
it impossible for him to give a decided refusal. He answered,
therefore, that "the remedy would be worse than the disease;<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a>
but that if the Emperor, who was so good a Catholic, judged a
council absolutely necessary, he would consent to it, under
the express condition, however, that the Protestants should submit
in the meanwhile to the doctrines and rites of the Church."
Then as the place of meeting he appointed Rome!</p>

<p>Scarcely had the news of this concession spread abroad,
than the fear of a Reformation froze the Papal court. The
public charges of the Papacy, which were altogether venal,
immediately fell, says a cardinal, and were offered at the
lowest price,<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> without even being able to find purchasers.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>
The Papacy was compromised; the merchandise was in
great danger; and the <i>price current</i> immediately declined
on the Roman exchange.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, 7th September, at two in the afternoon,
the Protestant princes and deputies having been introduced
into the chamber of Charles the Fifth, the Count-palatine
said to them, "that the Emperor, considering their small
number, had not expected they would uphold new sects
against the ancient usages of the Universal Church; that,
nevertheless, being desirous of appearing to the last full of
kindness, he would require of his Holiness the convocation
of a council; but that in the meanwhile they should return
immediately into the bosom of the Catholic Church, and restore
everything to its ancient footing."<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">MENACES.</div>

<p>The Protestants replied on the morrow, the 8th September,
that they had not stirred up new sects contrary to the Holy
Scriptures;<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> that, quite the reverse, if they had not agreed
with their adversaries, it was because they had desired to
remain faithful to the Word of God; that by convoking
in Germany a general, free, and christian council, it would
only be doing what preceding diets had promised; but that
nothing should compel them to re-establish in their churches
an order of things opposed to the commandments of God.</p>

<p>It was eight in the evening when, after a long deliberation,
the Protestants were again called in. "His majesty," said
George Truchses to them, "is equally astonished both that
the Catholic members of the commissions have accorded so
much, and that the Protestant members have refused everything.
What is your party in the presence of his imperial
majesty, of his Papal holiness, of the electors, princes, estates
of the Empire, and other kings, rulers, and potentates of
Christendom? It is but just that the minority should yield
to the majority. Do you desire the means of conciliation to
be protracted, or do you persist in your answer? Speak
frankly; for if you persist, the Emperor will immediately
see to the defence of the Church. To-morrow at one o'clock
you will bring your final decision."</p>

<p>Never had such threatening words issued from Charles's
mouth. It was evident he wished to subdue the Protestants
by terror; but this end was not attained. They replied the
next day but one&mdash;a day more having been accorded them&mdash;that
new attempts at conciliation would only fatigue the Emperor
and the diet; that they only required regulations to
maintain political peace until the assembling of the council.<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a>
"Enough," replied the redoubtable Emperor; "I will reflect
upon it; but in the mean time let no one quit Augsburg."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ALTERCATIONS.</div>

<p>Charles the Fifth was embarrassed in a labyrinth from
which he knew not how to escape. The state had resolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
to interfere with the Church, and saw itself compelled to have
immediate recourse to its <i>ultima ratio</i>&mdash;the sword. Charles
did not desire war, and yet how could he now avoid it? If
he did not execute his threats, his dignity was compromised,
and his authority rendered contemptible. He sought an outlet
on one side or the other, but could find none. It therefore
only remained for him to close his eyes, and rush forward
without knowing what might happen. These thoughts disturbed
him: these cares preyed upon him; he was utterly
confounded.</p>

<p>It was now that the Elector sent to beg Charles would not
be offended if he left Augsburg. "Let him await my
answer," abruptly replied the Emperor; and the Elector
having rejoined that he would send his ministers to explain
his motives to his majesty: "Not so many speeches," resumed
Charles, with irritation; "let the Elector say whether
he will stay or not!"<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PROTESTANTISM RESISTS.</div>

<p>A rumour of the altercation between these two powerful
princes having spread abroad, the alarm became universal; it
was thought war would break out immediately, and there was
a great cry in all Augsburg.<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> It was evening: men were
running to and fro; they rushed into the hotels of the princes
and of the Protestant deputies, and addressed them with the
severest reproaches. "His imperial majesty," said they,
"is about to have recourse to the most energetic measures!"
They even declared that hostilities had begun: it was whispered
that the commander of Horneck (Walter of Kronberg),
elected by the Emperor grand-master of the Teutonic order,
was about to enter Prussia with an army, and dispossess
Duke Albert, converted by Luther.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> Two nights successively
the same tumult was repeated. They shouted, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
quarrelled, they fought, particularly in and before the mansions
of the princes: the war was nearly commencing in
Augsburg.</p>

<p>At that crisis (12th September), John Frederick, prince-electoral
of Saxony, quitted the city.</p>

<p>On the same day, or on the morrow, Jerome Wehe, chancellor
of Baden, and Count Truchses on the one side; Chancellor
Brück and Melancthon on the other, met at six in the
morning in the church of St. Maurice.<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a></p>

<p>Charles, notwithstanding his threats, could not decide on
employing force. He could no doubt by a single word to his
Spanish bands or to his German lansquenets have seized on
these inflexible men, and treated them like Moors. But how
could Charles, a Netherlander, a Spaniard, who had been
absent ten years from the Empire, dare, without raising all
Germany, offer violence to the favourites of the nation?
Would not the Roman-catholic princes themselves see in this
act an infringement of their privileges? War was unseasonable.
"Lutheranism is extending already from the Baltic to
the Alps," wrote Erasmus to the legate: "You have but one
thing to do: tolerate it."<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a></p>

<p>The negotiation begun in the Church of St. Maurice was
continued between the Margrave of Brandenburg and Count
Truchses. The Roman party only sought to save appearances,
and did not hesitate, besides, to sacrifice everything.
It asked merely for a few theatrical decorations&mdash;that the
Mass should be celebrated in the sacerdotal garment, with
chanting, reading, ceremonies, and its two canons.<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> All the
rest was referred to the next council, and the Protestants, till
then, should conduct themselves so as to render account to
God, to the council, and to his majesty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S EXHORTATION.</div>

<p>But on the side of the Protestants the wind had also
changed. Now they will no longer have peace with Rome:
the scales had at last fallen from their eyes, and they discovered
with affright the abyss into which they had so nearly
plunged. Jonas, Spalatin, and even Melancthon were agreed.
"We have hitherto obeyed the commandment of St. Paul,
<i>Be at peace with all men</i>," said they; "now we must obey
this commandment of Christ, <i>Beware ye of the leaven of the
Pharisees, which is hypocrisy</i>. On the side of our adversaries
is nothing but cunning and perfidy, and their only aim is to
stifle our doctrine, which is truth itself.<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> They hope to save

<p>Luther at the same time redoubled his entreaties to withdraw
his friends from Augsburg. "Return, return," cried
he to them; "return, even if it must be so, cursed by the
Pope and the Emperor.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> You have confessed Jesus Christ,

They have our Confession, they have the Gospel; let them
receive it, if they will; and if they will not, let them go&mdash;&mdash;.
If a war should come, let it come! We have prayed
enough; and we have discussed enough. The Lord is preparing
our adversaries as the victim for the sacrifice; he
will destroy their magnificence, and deliver his people. Yes!
he will preserve us even from Babylon, and from her burning
walls."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ELECTOR OF SAXONY.</div>

<p>XII. Thus Luther gave the signal of departure. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
replied to the Reformer's appeal, and all prepared to quit
Augsburg on Saturday, 17th September. At ten at night
Duke Ernest of Luneburg assembled the deputies of Nuremberg
and the ministers of the Landgrave in his hotel, and
announced to them that the Elector was determined to leave
the next morning, without informing any one, and that he
would accompany him. "Keep the secret," said he to them,
"and know that, if peace cannot be preserved, it will be a
trifling matter for me to lose, combating with you, all that
God has given me."<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a></p>

<p>The Elector's preparations betrayed his intentions. In
the middle of the night Duke Henry of Brunswick arrived
hastily at his hotel, beseeching him to wait,<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> and, towards
morning, Counts Truchses and Mansfeldt announced that,
on the morrow between seven and eight, the Emperor would
give him his <i>congé</i>.</p>

<p>On Monday, 19th September, the Elector purposing to leave
Augsburg immediately after his audience with Charles,
breakfasted at seven o'clock, then sent off his baggage and
his cooks,<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> and ordered his officers to be ready at ten o'clock.
At the moment when John quitted the hotel to wait upon the
Emperor, all the members of his household were drawn up
on each side booted and spurred;<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> but, having been introduced
to Charles, he was requested to wait two, four, or six
days longer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE RECESS OF AUGSBURG.</div>

<p>As soon as the Elector was alone with his allies, his indignation
burst forth, and he even became violent. "This
new delay will end in nothing,"<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> he said; "I am resolved
to set out, happen what may. It seems to me, from the manner
in which things are arranged, that I have now completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the air of a prisoner." The Margrave of Brandenburg
begged him to be calm. "I shall go," the Elector still replied.
At last he yielded, and having appeared again before
Charles the Fifth, he said, "I will wait until Friday next;
and, if nothing is done by that time, I shall leave forthwith."</p>

<p>Great was the anxiety of the Protestants during these four
days of expectation. Most of them doubted not that, by acceding
to Charles's prayers, they had delivered themselves
into the hands of their enemies. "The Emperor is deliberating
whether he ought to hang us or let us live," wrote
Brenz.<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> Fresh negotiations of Truchses were without success.<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a></p>

<p>All that now remained for the Emperor was to draw up,
in common with the Romish states, the <i>recess</i> of the diet.
This was done; and, that the Protestants might not complain
of its having been prepared without their knowledge, he assembled
them in his palace on Thursday, 22d September, the
day previous to that fixed for the Elector's departure, and had
his project read to them by the Count-palatine. This project
was insult and war. The Emperor granted to the
Elector, the five princes, and the six cities,<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> a delay of six
months, until the 15th April next year, to come to an arrangement
with the Church, the Pope, the Emperor, and all
the princes and monarchs of Christendom. This was clearly
announcing to them that the Romanists were very willing to
delay until the usual period for bringing armies into the
field.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IRRITATING LANGUAGE.</div>

<p>Nor was this all: this delay was granted only on the express
condition that the Protestants should immediately join the
Emperor in reducing the Anabaptists, and all those who
opposed the holy sacrament, by which were meant the Zwinglian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
cities. He wished by this means to tie the hands of
the Protestants, and prevent the two families of the Reform
from uniting during the winter.</p>

<p>Finally, the Protestants were forbidden to make any innovations,
to print or sell anything on the objects of faith, or to
draw any one whatever to their <i>sect</i>, "since the Confession
had been soundly refuted by the Holy Scriptures." Thus
they officially proclaimed the Reform a <i>sect</i>, and a sect contrary
to the Word of God.</p>

<p>Nothing was more calculated to displease the friends of
the Gospel, who remained in Charles's presence astonished,
alarmed, and indignant.<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> This had been foreseen; and, at
the moment when the Protestants were about to enter the
Emperor's chamber, Truchses and Wehe, making signs to
them, mysteriously slipped a paper into their hands, containing
a promise that, if, on the 15th April, the Protestants
required a prolongation of the delay, their request would certainly
be granted.<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> But Brück, to whom the paper was
given, was not deceived. "A subtle ambuscade," said he;
"a masterpiece of knavery! God will save his own, and
will not permit them to fall into the snare."<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> This trick, in
fact, served only still more to increase the courage of the
Protestants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INTIMIDATION.</div>

<p>Brück, without discussing the <i>recess</i> in a political point of
view, confined himself to what was principally at stake, the
Word of God. "We maintain," said he, "that our Confession
is so based on the holy Word of God, that it is impossible
to refute it. We consider it as the very truth of God,
and we hope by it to stand one day before the judgment-seat
of the Lord." He then announced that the Protestants had
refuted the Refutation of the Romish theologians, and holding
in his hand the famous Apology of the Confession of Augsburg
written by Melancthon, he stepped forward, and offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
it to Charles the Fifth. The Count-palatine took it, and the
Emperor was already stretching out his hand, when Ferdinand
having whispered a few words, he motioned the Count,
who immediately returned the Apology to Doctor Brück.<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a>
This paper and the "Commonplaces," are the masterpieces
of the Reformer. The embarrassed Emperor told the Protestants
to come again at eight the next morning.</p>

<p>Charles the Fifth, resolving to employ every means to get
his decree accepted, began by entreaties; and scarcely was
the Margrave of Brandenburg seated to take his evening repast,
when Truchses and Wehe, appearing before him, used
every kind of discourse and argument, but without success.<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a></p>

<p>The next day (Friday, 23d September), the Evangelical
princes and the deputies of the cities, assembling at five in
the morning in the Margrave's hotel, the <i>recess</i> was there
read anew in the presence of Truchses and Wehe, and Chancellor
Brück detailed seven reasons for its rejection. "I
undertake," said Wehe, "to translate the <i>recess</i> into German
in such a manner that you can accept it. As for the word
<i>sect</i>, in particular, it is the clerk who placed it there by mistake."<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>
The mediators retired in haste to communicate to
Charles the complaints of the Protestants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FINAL INTERVIEW.</div>

<p>Charles and his ministers gave up every idea of reconciliation,
and hoped for nothing except through fear. The
Protestants having arrived at eight o'clock at the imperial
palace, they were made to wait an hour; the Elector of
Brandenburg then said to them in Charles's name: "His
majesty is astonished beyond measure that you still maintain
your doctrine to be based on the holy Scriptures. If you said
the truth, his majesty's ancestors, so many kings and emperors,
and even the ancestors of the Elector of Saxony, would
have been heretics! There is no Gospel, there is no Scripture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
that imposes on us the obligation of seizing by violence
the goods of another, and of saying afterwards that we cannot
conscientiously restore them. It is for this reason," added
Joachim, after these words, which he had accompanied with
a sardonic smile, "I am commissioned to inform you, that
if you refuse the <i>recess</i>, all the Germanic states will place their
lives and their property at the Emperor's disposal, and his
majesty himself will employ the resources of all his kingdoms
to complete this affair before leaving the Empire."</p>

<p>"We do not accept it," replied the Protestants firmly,&mdash;"His
majesty also has a conscience," then resumed the
Elector of Brandenburg, in a harsh tone; "and if you do not
submit, he will concert with the Pope and the other potentates
on the best means of extirpating this sect and its new errors."
But in vain did they add threat to threat: the Protestants
remained calm, respectful, and unshaken. "Our enemies,
destitute of all confidence in God!" said they, "would
shake like a reed in presence of the Emperor's anger, and
they imagine that we should tremble in like manner; but we
have called unto God, and he will keep us faithful to his truth."</p>

<p>The Protestants then prepared to take their final leave of
the Emperor. This prince, whose patience had been put to a
severe trial, approached to shake hands according to custom:
and beginning with the Elector of Saxony, he said to him in
a low voice: "Uncle, uncle! I should never have expected
this of you." The Elector was deeply affected: his eyes filled
with tears: but, firm and resolute, he bent his head and
quitted Charles without reply. It was now two in the afternoon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MESSAGES OF PEACE.</div>

<p>While the Protestants were returning to their hotels, calm
and happy, the Romish princes returned to theirs, confused
and dispirited, uneasy and divided. They doubted not that
the <i>congé</i> that had just been given the Protestants would be
regarded by them as a declaration of war, and that on quitting
Augsburg, they would rush to arms. This thought terrified
them. Accordingly, the Elector of Saxony had hardly
reached his palace, when he saw Dr. Ruhel, councillor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
the Elector of Mentz, hastening towards him, commissioned by
his master to deliver this message: "Although my brother
the Elector (Joachim of Brandenburg) has declared that all
the states of the Empire are ready to support the Emperor
against you, know that both myself and the ministers of
the Elector-palatine and of the Elector of Treves immediately
declared to his majesty that we do not adhere to this declaration,
seeing that we think very favourably of you.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> I intended
saying this to the Emperor in your presence, but you left so
precipitately, that I was unable."</p>

<p>Thus spoke the primate of the German Church, and even
the choice of his messenger was significant: Dr. Ruhel was
Luther's brother-in-law. John begged him to thank his master.</p>

<p>As this envoy retired, there arrived one of the gentlemen
of Duke Henry of Brunswick, a zealous Romanist. He was
at first refused admittance on account of the departure, but
returned hastily, just as Brück's carriage was leaving the
court-yard of the hotel. Approaching the carriage-door, he
said: "The Duke informs the Elector that he will endeavour
to put things in a better train, and will come this winter to
kill a wild boar with him."<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> Shortly after, the terrible
Ferdinand himself declared that he would seek every means
of preventing an outbreak.<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> All these manifestations of the
affrighted Roman-catholics showed on which side was the
real strength.</p>

<p>At three o'clock in the afternoon the Elector of Saxony,
accompanied by the Dukes of Luneburg and the Princes of
Anhalt, quitted the walls of Augsburg. "God be praised,"
said Luther, "that our dear prince is at last out of hell."<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">RESTORATION OF POPERY.</div>

<p>As he saw these intrepid princes thus escaping from his
hands, Charles the Fifth gave way to a violence that was not
usual with him.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> "They want to teach me a new faith,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
cried he: "but it is not with the doctrine that we shall finish
this matter: we must draw the sword, and we shall then see
who is the strongest."<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> There was a concert of indignation
around him. They were astonished at the audacity of Brück,
who had dared call the Romanists&mdash;heretics!<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> But nothing
irritated them so much as the spirit of proselytism which in
those glorious days characterized Evangelical Germany;
and the anger of the Papists was particularly directed against
the Chancellor of Luneburg, "who," said they, "had sent
more than a hundred ministers into different places to preach
the new doctrine, and who had even publicly boasted of
it."<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a>&mdash;"Our adversaries thirst for our blood," wrote, as they
heard these complaints, the deputies of Nuremberg, who remained
almost alone at Augsburg.</p>

<p>On the 4th October, Charles the Fifth wrote to the Pope;
for it was from Rome that the new crusade was to set out.
"The negotiations are broken off; our adversaries are more
obstinate than ever; and I am resolved to employ my strength
and my person in combating them. For this reason I beg
your holiness will demand the support of all christian
princes."</p>

<div class="sidenote">TUMULT IN THE CHURCH.</div>

<p>The enterprise began in Augsburg itself. The day on
which he wrote to the Pope, Charles, in honor of St. Francis
of Assisi, whose feast it was, re-established the Cordeliers in
that city, and a monk ascending the pulpit said: "All those
who preach that Jesus Christ alone has made satisfaction for
our sins, and that God saves us without regard to our works,
are thorough scoundrels. There are, on the contrary, two
roads to salvation: the common road, namely, the observance
of the commandments; and the perfect road, namely, the
ecclesiastical state." Scarcely was the sermon finished ere
they began to remove the benches placed in the church for
the Evangelical preaching, breaking them violently (for they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
were fixed with chains), and throwing them one upon another.
Within these consecrated walls two monks, in particular,
armed with hammers and pincers, tossed their arms, and
shouted like men possessed. "From this frightful uproar,"
exclaimed some, "one would say they were pulling down a
house."<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> It was in truth the house of God that they wished
to begin destroying.</p>

<p>After the tumult was appeased, they sang Mass; then a
Spaniard desiring to recommence breaking the benches, and
being prevented by one of the citizens, they began to hurl
chairs at each other; one of the monks, leaving the choir,
ran up to them and was soon dragged into the fray; at length
the captain of police arrived with his men, who distributed
their well-directed blows on every side. Thus recommenced
in Germany the restoration of Roman-catholicism: popular
violence has often been one of its most powerful allies.</p>

<p>On the 13th October the <i>recess</i> was read to all the Romish
states, and on the same day they concluded a Roman league.<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a></p>

<p>Two cities had signed the Confession, and two others had
assented to it; the Imperialists hoped, however, that these
powerless municipalities, affrighted at the imperial authority,
would withdraw from the Protestant union. But on the 17th
October, instead of two or four cities, sixteen imperial cities,
among which were the most important in Germany, declared
it was impossible to grant any support against the Turks, so
long as public peace was not secured in Germany itself.<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">UNION OF THE CHURCHES.</div>

<p>An event more formidable to Charles had just taken place.
The unity of the Reformation had prevailed. "We are one
in the fundamental articles of faith," had said the Zwinglian
cities, "and in particular (notwithstanding some disputes
about words among our theologians), we are <i>one</i> in the doctrine
of the communion in the body and blood of our Lord.
Receive us." The Saxon deputies immediately gave their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
hands. Nothing unites the children of God so much as the
violence of their adversaries. "Let us unite," said all, "for
the consolation of our brethren and the terror of our enemies."<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a></p>

<p>In vain did Charles, who was intent on keeping up the division
among the Protestants, convoke the deputies of the Zwinglian
cities; in vain, desiring to render them odious, had he
accused them of fastening a consecrated wafer to a wall and
firing bullets at it;<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> in vain did he overwhelm them with
fierce threats;&mdash;all his efforts were useless. At length the
Evangelical party was one.</p>

<p>The alarm increased among the Roman party, who resolved
on fresh concessions. "The Protestants call for public
peace," said they: "well then, let us draw up articles of
peace." But, on the 29th October, the Protestants refused
these offers, because the Emperor enjoined peace to all the
world, without binding himself. "An Emperor has the right
to command peace to his subjects," haughtily answered
Charles; "but it has never been heard that he commanded it
to himself."<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a></p>

<p>Nothing remained but to draw the sword; and for that
Charles made every preparation. On the 25th October, he
wrote to the cardinals at Rome: "We inform you that we
shall spare neither kingdoms nor lordships; and that we shall
venture even our soul and our body to complete things so
necessary."</p>

<div class="sidenote">CLOSE OF THE DIET.</div>

<p>Scarcely had Charles's letter been received, before his
major-domo, Pedro de la Cueva, arrived in Rome by express.
"The season is now too far advanced to attack the Lutherans
immediately," said he to the Pope; "but prepare everything
for this enterprise. His majesty thinks it his duty to prefer
before all things the accomplishment of your designs."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Thus Clement and the Emperor were also united, and both
sides began to concentrate their forces.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 11th November, the <i>recess</i> was read
to the Protestant deputies, and on the 12th they rejected it,
declaring that they did not acknowledge the Emperor's power
to command in matters of faith.<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> The deputies of Hesse and
of Saxony departed immediately after, and on the 19th November
the <i>recess</i> was solemnly read in the presence of
Charles the Fifth, and of the princes and deputies who were
still in Augsburg. This report was more hostile than the
project communicated to the Protestants. It bore, among other
things (this is only a sample of the urbanity of this official
doctrine), that "to deny free-will was the error not of a man,
but of a brute."&mdash;"We beg his majesty," said the Elector
Joachim, after it was read, "not to leave Germany, until by
his cares one sole and same faith be re-established in all the
Empire."</p>

<p>The Emperor replied, that he would not go farther than his
states of the Low Countries. They desired deeds should follow
close upon words. It was then nearly seven in the evening;
a few torches, lighted here and there by the ushers, and
casting a pale light, alone illuminated this assembly: they
separated without seeing each other; and thus ended, as it
were by stealth, that diet so pompously announced to the
christian world.</p>

<p>On the 22d November, the <i>recess</i> was made public, and
two days after Charles the Fifth set out for Cologne. The
ruler of two worlds had seen all his power baffled by a few
Christians; and he who had entered the imperial city in
triumph, now quitted it gloomy, silent, and dispirited. The
mightiest power of the earth was broken against the power of
God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ATTACK ON GENEVA.</div>

<p>But the Emperor's ministers and officers, excited by the
Pope, displayed so much the more energy. The states of
the Empire were bound to furnish Charles for three years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
40,000 foot, 8000 horse, and a considerable sum of money;<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a>
the Margrave Henry of Zenete, the Count of Nassau, and
other nobles, made considerable levies on the side of the
Rhine; a captain going through the Black Forest called its
rude inhabitants to his standard, and there enrolled six companies
of lansquenets; King Ferdinand had written to all the
knights of the Tyrol and of Wurtemberg to gird on their
cuirasses and to seize their swords; Joachim of Talheim collected
the Spanish bands in the Low Countries, and ordered
them towards the Rhine; Peter Scher solicited from the
Duke of Lorraine the aid of his arms; and another chief
hastily moved the Spanish army of Florence in the direction
of the Alps. There was every reason to fear that the
Germans, even the Roman-catholics, would take Luther's
part; and hence principally foreign troops were levied.<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a>
Nothing but war was talked of in Augsburg.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JOY OF THE EVANGELICALS.</div>

<p>On a sudden a strange rumour was heard.<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> The signal
is given, said every one. A free city, lying on the confines
of the Germanic and Roman world,&mdash;a city at war with its
bishop, in alliance with the Protestants, and which passes
for reformed even before really being so, has been suddenly
attacked. A courier from Strasburg brings this news to
Augsburg, and it circulates throughout the town with the
rapidity of lightning. Three days after Michaelmas, some
armed men, sent by the Duke of Savoy, pillaged the suburbs
of Geneva, and threatened to take possession of the city, and
put all to the edge of the sword. Every one in Augsburg
was amazed. "Ho!" exclaimed Charles the Fifth, in
French, "the Duke of Savoy has begun too soon."<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> It
was reported that Magaret, governor of the Low Countries,
the Pope, the Dukes of Lorraine and Guelders, and even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
King of France, were directing their troops against Geneva.
It was there that the army of Rome intended fixing its <i>point
d'appui</i>. The avalanche was gathering on the first slopes
of the Alps, whence it would rush over all Switzerland, and
then roll into Germany, burying the Gospel and the Reformation
under its huge mass.<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a></p>

<p>Never had this sacred cause appeared to be in such great
danger, and never in reality had it gained so noble a triumph.
The <i>coup de main</i> attempted on those hills, where six years
later Calvin was to take his station, and plant the standard
of Augsburg and of Nazareth, having failed, all fears were
dispelled, and the victory of the confessors of Christ, for an
instant obscured, shone forth anew in all its splendour.</p>

<p>While the Emperor Charles, surrounded by a numerous train
of princes, was approaching the banks of the Rhine sad and
dispirited, the Evangelical Christians were returning in triumph
to their homes. Luther was the herald of the victory
gained at Augsburg by Faith. "Though our enemies should
have around them, beside them, with them, not only that puissant
Roman Emperor, Charles, but still more the Emperor
of the Turks and his Mahomet," said he, "they could not
intimidate, they could not frighten me. It is I who in the
strength of God am resolved to frighten and overthrow them.
They shall yield to me&mdash;they shall fall! and I shall remain
upright and firm. My life shall be their headsman, and my
death their hell!<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a>......God blinds them and hardens their
hearts; he is driving them towards the Red Sea: all the horses
of Pharaoh, his chariots and his horsemen, cannot escape their
inevitable destiny. Let them go then, let them perish, since
they will it so!<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> As for us, the Lord is with us."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ESTABLISHMENT OF PROTESTANTISM.</div>

<p>Thus the Diet of Augsburg, destined to crush the Reformation,
was what strengthened it for ever. It has been usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
to consider the peace of Augsburg (1555) as the period when
the Reform was definitively established. That is the date of
legal Protestantism; Evangelical Christianity has another&mdash;the
autumn of 1530. In 1555 was the victory of the sword
and of diplomacy; in 1530 was that of the Word of God and
of Faith; and this latter victory is in our eyes the truest and
the firmest. The evangelical history of the Reformation in
Germany is nearly finished at the epoch we have reached,
and the diplomatic history of legal Protestantism begins.
Whatever may be done now, whatever may be said, the
Church of the first ages has reappeared; and it has reappeared
strong enough to show that it will live. There will still
be conferences and discussions; there will still be leagues
and combats; there will even be deplorable defeats; but all
that is a secondary movement. The great movement is
accomplished: the cause of Faith is won by Faith. The
effort has been made: the Evangelical doctrine has taken root
in the world, and neither the storms of men, nor the powers
of hell, will ever be able to tear it up.</p>

<h2>BOOK XV.</h2>

<h3>SWITZERLAND&mdash;CONQUESTS. 1526-1530.</h3>


<p>I. The divisions which the Reformation disclosed within
its bosom, on its appearance before the Diet of Augsburg,
humbled it and compromised its existence; but we must
not forget that the cause of these divisions was one of the
conditions of the existence of the regenerated Church. No
doubt it would have been desirable for Germany and Switzerland
to have agreed; but it was of still greater importance
that Germany and Switzerland should have each its
original Reform. If the Swiss Reformation had been only a
feeble copy of the German, there would have been uniformity,
but no duration. The tree, transplanted into Switzerland,
without having taken deep root, would soon have been torn
up by the vigorous hand that was erelong about to seize upon
it. The regeneration of Christianity in these mountains proceeded
from forces peculiar to the Helvetic Church, and
received an organization in conformity with the ecclesiastical
and political condition of that country. By this very originality
it communicated a particular energy to the principles
of the Reformation, of much greater consequence to the
common cause than a servile uniformity. The strength
of an army arises in great measure from its being composed
of soldiers of different arms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THREE PERIODS OF REFORM.</div>

<p>The military and political influence of Switzerland was
declining. The new developments of the European nations,
subsequent to the sixteenth century, were about to banish to
their native mountains those proud Helvetians, who for so long
a period had placed their two-handed swords in the balance
in which the destinies of nations were weighed. The
Reformation communicated a new influence in exchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266b" id="Page_266b">[266]</a></span>
for that which was departing. Switzerland, where the Gospel
appeared in its simplest and purest form, was destined
to give in these new times to many nations of the two worlds
a more salutary and glorious impulse than that which had
hitherto proceeded from its halberds and its arquebuses.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The history of the Swiss Reformation is divided into three
periods, in which the light of the Gospel is seen spreading
successively over three different zones. From 1519 to
1526 Zurich was the centre of the Reformation, which was
then entirely German, and was propagated in the eastern and
northern parts of the Confederation. Between 1526 and
1532 the movement was communicated from Berne: it is at
once German and French, and extended to the centre of
Switzerland from the gorges of the Jura to the deepest valleys
of the Alps. In 1532 Geneva became the focus of the
light; and the Reformation, which was here essentially
French, was established on the shores of the Leman lake,
and gained strength in every quarter. It is of the second of
these periods&mdash;that of Berne&mdash;of which we are now to treat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TWO MOVEMENTS IN THE CHURCH.</div>

<p>Although the Swiss Reformation is not yet essentially
French, still the most active part in it is taken by Frenchmen.
Switzerland <i>Romande</i><a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> is yoked to the chariot of
Reform, and communicates to it an accelerated motion. In
the period we are about to treat of, there is a mixture of
races, of forces, and of characters, from which proceeds a
greater commotion. In no part of the christian world will
the resistance be so stubborn; but nowhere will the assailants
display so much courage. This petty country of Switzerland
Romande, enclosed within the colossal arms of the
Jura and the Alps, was for centuries one of the strongest fortresses
of the Papacy. It is about to be carried by storm;
it is going to turn its arms against its ancient masters; and
from these few hillocks, scattered at the foot of the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267b" id="Page_267b">[267]</a></span>
mountains in Europe, will proceed the reiterated shocks
that will overthrow, even in the most distant countries, the
sanctuaries of Rome, their images and their altars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AGGRESSIVE SPIRIT.</div>

<p>There are two movements in the Church: one is effected
inwardly, and its object is its preservation; the other is
effected outwardly, and the object aimed at is its propagation.
There is thus a doctrinal Church and a missionary
Church. These two movements ought never to be separated,
and whenever they are disunited, it is because the spirit of
man, and not the spirit of God prevails. In the apostolic
ages these two tendencies were evolved at the same time and
with equal power. In the second and third centuries the
external tendency prevailed; after the Council of Nice (325)
the doctrinal movement resumed the superiority; at the epoch
of the irruption of the northern tribes the missionary spirit
revived; but erelong came the times of the hierarchy and
of the schoolmen, in which all doctrinal powers warred within
the Church to found therein despotic government and an
impure doctrine&mdash;the Papacy. The revival of Christianity
in the sixteenth century, which emanated from God, was
destined to renovate these two doctrines, but by purifying
them. Then indeed the spirit of God acted at once externally
and internally. In the days of the Reformation there were
tranquil and internal developments; but there was also a more
powerful and aggressive action. Men of God had for ages
studied the Word, and had peacefully explained its salutary
lessons. Such had been the work of Vesalia, Goch, Groot,
Radewin, Ruybrook, Tauler, Thomas à Kempis, and John
Wessel; now, something more was required. The power of
action was to be united with the power of thought. The
Papacy had been allowed all necessary time for laying aside
its errors; for ages men had been in expectation; it had
been warned, it had been entreated; all had been unavailing.
Popery being unwilling to reform itself, it became
necessary for men of God to take its accomplishment upon
themselves. The calm and moderate influence of the precursors
of the Reform was succeeded by the heroic and holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268b" id="Page_268b">[268]</a></span>
revolutionary work of the Reformers; and the revolution
they effected consisted in overthrowing the usurping power
to re-establish the legitimate authority. "To everything
there is a season," says the Preacher, "and a time to every
purpose under heaven: a time to plant, and a time to pluck
up that which is planted; a time to break down, and a time
to build up."<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> Of all Reformers, those who carried the aggressive
spirit to its highest degree were the men who came
from France, and more especially Farel, whose labours we
have now to consider.</p>

<p>Never were such mighty effects accomplished by so puny
a force. In the government of God we pass in an instant
from the greatest to the least of things. We now quit the
haughty Charles V. and all that court of princes over which
he presides, to follow the steps of a schoolmaster; and we
leave the palaces of Augsburg to take our seats in the lowly
cottages of Switzerland.</p>

<p>The Rhone, after issuing near St. Gothard from the mountains
of the Furka, from beneath an immense sea of eternal
ice, rolls its noisy waters through a rugged valley separating
the two great chains of the Alps; then issuing from the
gorge of St. Maurice, it wanders through a more smiling and
fertile country. The sublime Dent du Midi on the south, the
proud Dent de Morcles on the north, picturesquely situated
opposite each other, point out from afar to the traveller's eye
the beginning of this latter basin. On the tops of these mountains
are vast glaciers and threatening peaks, near which
the shepherds in the midst of summer lead their numerous
flocks to pasture; while in the plain, the flowers and fruits of
southern climes grow luxuriantly, and the laurel blooms beside
the most exquisite grapes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SCHOOLMASTER.</div>

<p>At the opening of one of the lateral valleys that lead into
the Northern Alps, on the banks of the Grande Eau that
falls in thunder from the glaciers of the Diablerets, is situated
the small town of Aigle, one of the most southern in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269b" id="Page_269b">[269]</a></span>
Switzerland. For about fifty years it had belonged to
Berne, with the four parishes (<i>mandemens</i>) which are under
its jurisdiction, namely, Aigle, Bex, Ollon, and the chalets
scattered in the lofty valleys of the Ormonds. It is in this
country that the second epoch of the Swiss Reformation was
destined to begin.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1526-1527, a foreign schoolmaster, named
Ursinus, arrived in this humble district. He was a man of
middle stature, with red beard and quick eyes, and who, to
a voice of thunder (says Beza), united the feelings of a hero:
his modest lessons were intermingled with new and strange
doctrines. The benefices being abandoned by their titularies
to ignorant curates, the people, who were naturally of rude
and turbulent habits, had remained without any cultivation.
Thus did this stranger, who was no other than Farel, meet
with new obstacles at every step.</p>

<p>Whilst Lefevre and most of his friends had quitted Strasburg
to re-enter France, after the deliverance of Francis I.,
Farel had turned his steps towards Switzerland; and on the
very first day of his journey, he received a lesson that he
frequently recalled to mind.</p>

<p>He was on foot, accompanied by a single friend. Night
had closed around them, the rain fell in torrents, and the
travellers, in despair of finding their road, had sat down
midway, drenched with rain.<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> "Ah!" said Farel, "God,
by showing me my helplessness in these little things, has
willed to teach me what I am in the greatest, without Jesus
Christ!" At last Farel, springing up, plunged into the
marshes, waded through the waters, crossed vineyards, fields,
hills, forests, and valleys, and at length reached his destination,
covered with mud and soaked to the skin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREL'S STUDIES.</div>

<p>In this night of desolation, Farel had received a new baptism.
His natural energy had been quelled; he became,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270b" id="Page_270b">[270]</a></span>
for some time at least, wise as a serpent and harmless as a
dove; and, as not unfrequently happens to men of such disposition,
he at first overstepped his aim. Believing that he
was following the example of the Apostles, he sought, in the
words of &OElig;colampadius, "to circumvent by pious frauds the
old serpent that was hissing around him."<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> He represented
himself to be a schoolmaster, and waited until a door should
be opened to him to appear as a Reformer.<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a></p>

<p>Scarcely had Magister Ursinus quitted the schoolroom and
his primers, than, taking refuge in his modest chamber,
he became absorbed in the Greek and Hebrew Scriptures,
and the most learned treatises of the theologians. The struggle
between Luther and Zwingle was commencing. To
which of these two chiefs should the French Reform attach
itself? Luther had been known in France for a much
longer time than Zwingle; yet Farel decided in favour of
the latter. Mysticism had characterized the Germanic nations
during the Middle Ages, and scholasticism those of Roman
descent. The French were in closer relation with
the dialectician Zwingle than with the mystic Luther; or
rather, they were the mediators between the two great tendencies
of the Middle Ages; and, while giving to the christian
thought that correct form which seems to be the province
of southern nations, they became the instruments of God to
spread through the Church the fulness of life and of the Spirit
of Christ.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DOOR IS OPENED.</div>

<p>It was in this little chamber at Aigle that Farel read the
first publication addressed to the German by the Swiss
Reformer.<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> "With what learning," cries he, "does Zwingle
scatter the darkness! with what holy ingenuity he gains over
the wise, and what captivating meekness he unites with a forcible
erudition! Oh, that by the grace of God this work may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271b" id="Page_271b">[271]</a></span>
win over Luther, so that the Church of Christ, trembling
from such violent shocks, may at length find peace!"<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a></p>

<p>The schoolmaster Ursinus, excited by so noble an example,
gradually set about instructing the parents as well as the
children. He at first attacked the doctrine of purgatory,
and next the invocation of Saints. "As for the Pope, he is
nothing," said he, "or almost nothing, in these parts;<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> and
as for the priests, provided they annoy the people with all
that nonsense, which Erasmus knows so well how to turn into
ridicule, that is enough for them."</p>

<p>Ursinus had been some months at Aigle: a door was
opened to him; a flock had been collected there, and he
believed the looked for moment had arrived.</p>

<p>Accordingly, one day the prudent schoolmaster disappears.
"I am William Farel," said he, "minister of the Word of
God." The terror of the priests and magistrates was great,
when they saw in the midst of them that very man whose
name had already become so formidable. The schoolmaster
quitted his humble study; he ascended the pulpit, and openly
preached Jesus Christ to the astonished multitude. The work
of Ursinus was over: Farel was himself again.<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> It was
then about the month of March or April, 1527, and in that
beautiful valley, whose slopes were brightening in the warm
rays of the sun, all was fermenting at the same time, the flowers,
the vineyards, and the hearts of this sensible but rude people.</p>

<p>Yet the rocks that the torrent meets as it issues from the
Diablerets, and against which it dashes at every step as it
falls from eternal snows, are more trifling obstacles than the
prejudice and hatred that were shown erelong in this populous
valley to the Word of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OPPOSITION.</div>

<p>The Council of Berne, by a license of the 9th of March,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272b" id="Page_272b">[272]</a></span>
had commissioned Farel to explain the Holy Scriptures to the
people of Aigle and its neighbourhood. But the arm of the
civil magistrate, by thus mingling in religious affairs, served
only to increase the irritation of men's minds. The rich
and lazy incumbents, the poor and ignorant curates, were the
first to cry out. "<i>If</i> this man," said they one to another, "continues
preaching, it is all over with our benefices and our
Church."<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of this agitation, the bailiff of Aigle and the
governor of the four mandemens, Jacques de Roverea, instead
of supporting the minister of their excellencies of Berne,
eagerly embraced the cause of the priests. "The Emperor,"
said they, "is about to declare war against all innovators.
A great army will shortly arrive from Spain to assist the
Archduke Ferdinand."<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> Farel stood firm. Upon this the
bailiff and Roverea, exasperated by such boldness, interdicted
the heretic from every kind of instruction, whether as minister
or schoolmaster. But Berne caused to be posted on the
doors of all the churches in the four mandemens a new
decree, dated the 3d of July, in which their excellencies, manifesting
great displeasure at this interdiction "of the very
learned Farel from the propagation of the Divine Word,<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> ordered
all the officers of the state to allow him to preach publicly
the doctrines of the Lord."</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAUSANNE.</div>

<p>This new proclamation was the signal of revolt. On the
25th July great crowds assembled at Aigle, at Bex, at Ollon,
and in the Ormonds, crying out, "No more submission to
Berne! down with Farel!" From words they soon proceeded
to actions. At Aigle the insurgents, headed by the fiery
syndic, tore down the edict, and prepared to fall upon the Reformed.
These, uniting with promptitude, surrounded Farel,
resolved to defend him. The two parties met face to
face, and blood was near flowing. The firm countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273b" id="Page_273b">[273]</a></span>
of the friends of the Gospel checked the partisans of the
priests, who dispersed, and Farel, quitting Aigle for a few
days, carried his views farther.</p>

<p>In the middle of the beautiful valley of the Leman, on
hills which overlook the lake, stands Lausanne, the city of the
bishop and of the Virgin, placed under the patronage of the
Dukes of Savoy. A host of pilgrims, assembling from all the
surrounding places, knelt devoutly before the image of Our
Lady, and made costly purchases at the great fair of indulgences
that was held in its precincts. Lausanne, extending
its episcopal crosier from its lofty towers, pretended to keep
the whole country at the feet of the Pope. But the eyes of
many began to be opened, thanks to the dissolute life of the
canons and priests. The ministers of the Virgin were seen
in public playing at games of chance, which they seasoned
with mockery and blasphemy. They fought in the churches;
disguised as soldiers, they descended by night from the cathedral
hill, and roaming through the streets, sword in hand
and in liquor, surprised, wounded, and sometimes even killed
the worthy citizens; they debauched married women, seduced
young girls, changed their residences into houses of ill-fame,
and heartlessly turned out their young children to beg
their bread.<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> Nowhere, perhaps, was better exemplified
the description of the clergy given us by one of the most
venerable prelates of the sixteenth century: "Instead of training
up youth by their learning and holiness of life, the priests
train birds and dogs; instead of books, they have children;
they sit with topers in the taverns, and give way to drunkenness."<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREL AT LAUSANNE.</div>

<p>Among the theologians in the court of the bishop Sebastian
of Montfaucon, was Natalis Galeotto, a man of elevated rank
and great urbanity, fond of the society of scholars, and himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274b" id="Page_274b">[274]</a></span>
a man of learning,<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> but nevertheless very zealous about
fasts and all the ordinances of the Church. Farel thought
that, if this man could be gained over to the Gospel, Lausanne,
"slumbering at the foot of its steeples," would perhaps
awaken, and all the country with it. He therefore
addressed himself to him. "Alas! alas!" said Farel, "religion
is no longer but an empty mockery, since people, who
think only of their appetites, are the kings of the Church.
Christian people, instead of celebrating in the sacrament the
death of the Lord, live as if they commemorated Mercury,
the god of fraud. Instead of imitating the love of Christ, they
emulate the lewdness of Venus; and when they do evil, they
fear more the presence of a wretched swineherd than of God
Almighty."<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a></p>

<p>But Galeotto made no reply, and Farel persevered,
"Knock; cry out with all your might," wrote he in a second
letter; "redouble your attacks upon our Lord."<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> Still there
was no answer. Farel returned to the charge a third time,
and Natalis, fearing to reply in person, commissioned his
secretary, who forwarded a letter to Farel full of insulting
language.<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> For a season Lausanne was inaccessible.</p>

<p>After having thus contended with a priest, Farel was
destined to struggle with a monk. The two arms of the
hierarchy by which the Middle Ages were governed had
been chivalry and monachism. The latter still remained for
the service of the Papacy, although falling into decay.
"Alas!" exclaimed a celebrated Carthusian, "what an
obstinate devil would fear to do, a reprobate and arrogant
monk will commit without hesitation."<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275b" id="Page_275b">[275]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">FAREL AND THE MONK.</div>

<p>A mendicant friar, who dared not oppose the reformer in a
direct manner at Aigle, ventured into the village of Noville,
situated on the low grounds deposited by the Rhone as it
falls into the lake of Geneva. The friar, ascending the pulpit,
exclaimed, "It is the devil himself who preaches by the
mouth of the minister, and all those who listen to him will
be damned." Then, taking courage, he slunk along the bank
of the Rhone, and arrived at Aigle with a meek and humble
look, not to appear there against Farel, whose powerful eloquence
terribly alarmed him, but to beg in behalf of his
convent a few barrels of the most exquisite wine in all Switzerland.
He had not advanced many steps into the town before
he met the minister. At this sight he trembled in every limb.
"Why did you preach in such a manner at Noville?" demanded
Farel. The monk, fearful that the dispute would
attract public attention, and yet desirous of replying to the
point, whispered in his ear, "I have heard say, that you are
a heretic and misleader of the people." "Prove it," said
Farel. Then the monk "began to storm," says Farel,<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> and,
hastening down the street, endeavoured to shake off his disagreeable
companion, "turning now this way, now that, like
a troubled conscience."<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> A few citizens beginning to collect
around them, Farel said to them, pointing to the monk,
"You see this fine father; he has said from the pulpit that I
preach nothing but lies." Then the monk, blushing and
stammering, began to speak of the offerings of the faithful
(the precious wine of Yvorne, for which he had come begging),
and accused Farel of opposing them. The crowd had now
increased in number, and Farel, who only sought an opportunity
of proclaiming the true worship of God, exclaimed,
with a loud voice, "It is no man's business to ordain any

either to the right hand or to the left.<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> Let us worship God
alone in spirit and in truth, offering to him a broken and a
contrite heart."</p>

<p>The eyes of all the spectators were fixed on the two actors
in this scene, the monk with his wallet, and the reformer
with his glistening eye. Confounded by Farel's daring to
speak of any other worship than that which the holy Roman
Church prescribed, the friar was out of his senses; he trembled,
and was agitated, becoming pale and red by turns. At
last, taking his cap off his head, from under his hood, he
flung it on the ground, trampling it under foot, and crying:
"I am amazed that the earth does not gape and swallow us
up!"<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a>......Farel wished to reply, but in vain. The
friar with downcast eyes kept stamping on his cap, "bawling
out like one out of his wits:" and his cries resounding through
the streets of Aigle, drowned the voice of the reformer. At
length one of the spectators, who stood beside him, plucked
him by the sleeve, and said, "listen to the minister, as he is
listening to you." The affrighted monk, believing himself
already half-dead, started violently and cried out: "Oh, thou
excommunicate! layest thou thy hand upon me?"</p>

<p>The little town was in an uproar; the friar at once furious
and trembling, Farel following up his attack with vigour, and
the people in confusion and amazement. At length the magistrate
appeared, ordered the monk and Farel to follow him,
and shut them up, "one in one tower and one in another."<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a></p>

<p>On the Saturday morning Farel was liberated from his
prison, and conducted to the castle before the officers of justice,
where the monk was already present. The minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
began to address them: "My lords, to whom our Saviour
enjoins obedience without any exception, this friar has said
that the doctrine which I preach is against God. Let him
make good his words, or, if he cannot, permit your people to
be edified." The violence of the monk was over. The
tribunal before which he was standing, the courage of his
adversary, the power of the movement which he could not
resist, the weakness of his cause&mdash;all alarmed him, and he
was now ready to make matters up. "Then the friar fell
upon his knees, saying: My lords, I entreat forgiveness of
you and of God. Next turning to Farel: And also, Magister,
what I preached against you was grounded on false reports.
I have found you to be a good man, and your doctrine
good, and I am prepared to recall my words."<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a></p>

<p>Farel was touched by this appeal, and said: "My friend,
do not ask forgiveness of me, for I am a poor sinner like
other men, putting my trust not in my own righteousness, but
in the death of Jesus."<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a></p>

<p>One of the lords of Berne coming up at this time, the friar,
who already imagined himself on the brink of martyrdom,
began to wring his hands, and to turn now towards the Bernese
councillors, now towards the tribunal, and then to Farel,
crying, "Pardon, pardon!"&mdash;"Ask pardon of our Saviour,"
replied Farel. The lord of Berne added: "Come to-morrow
and hear the minister's sermon; if he appears to you to
preach the truth, you shall confess it openly before all; if
not, you will declare your opinion: this promise in my hand."
The monk held out his hand, and the judges retired. "Then
the friar went away, and I have not seen him since, and no
promises or oaths were able to make him stay."<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> Thus the
Reformation advanced in Switzerland Romande.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">OPPOSITION TO THE GOSPEL.</div>

<p>But violent storms threatened to destroy the work that was
hardly begun. Romish agents from the Valais and from
Savoy had crossed the Rhone at St. Maurice, and were exciting
the people to energetic resistance. Tumultuous assemblages
took place, in which dangerous projects were discussed;
the proclamations of the government were torn down
from the church-doors; troops of citizens paraded the city;
the drum beat in the streets to excite the populace against the
reformer: everywhere prevailed riot and sedition. Thus on
the 16th February, Farel ascended the pulpit for the first time
after a short absence, some Papist bands collected round the
gate of the church, raised their hands in tumult, uttered
savage cries, and compelled the minister to break off in his
sermon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CONVERTED MONK.</div>

<p>The council of Berne thereupon decreed that the parishioners
of the four mandemens should assemble. Those of Bex
declared for the Reform; Aigle followed their example, but
with indecision; and in the mountains above Ollon, the peasants
not daring to maltreat Farel, set their wives at him, who
rushed upon him with their fulling-clubs. But it was especially
the parish of the Ormonds which, calm and proud at
the foot of its glaciers, signalized itself by its resistance. A
companion of Farel's labourers, named Claude (probably
Claude de Glontinis), when preaching there one day with
great animation, was suddenly interrupted by the ringing of
the bells, whose noise was such that one might have said all
hell was busy pulling them. "In fact," says another herald
of the Gospel, Jacques Comralis, who chanced to be present,
"it was Satan himself, who, breathing his anger into some of
his agents, filled the ears of the auditors with all this uproar."<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a>
At another time, some zealous Reformers having
thrown down the altars of Baal, according to the language of
the times, the evil spirit began to blow with violence in all
the chalets scattered over the sides of the mountains; the
shepherds issued precipitously like avalanches, and fell upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the Church and the Reformers. "Let us only find these
sacrilegious wretches," cried the furious Ormondines; "we
will hang them,&mdash;we will cut off their heads,&mdash;we will burn
them,&mdash;we will throw their ashes into the Great Water."<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a>
Thus were these mountaineers agitated, like the wind that
roars in their lofty valleys with a fury unknown to the inhabitants
of the plains.</p>

<p>Other difficulties overwhelmed Farel. His fellow-labourers
were not all of them blameless. One Christopher Ballista,
formerly a monk of Paris, had written to Zwingle: "I am
but a Gaul, a barbarian,<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> but you will find me a man pure
as snow, without any guile, of open heart, through whose
windows all the world may see."<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> Zwingle sent Ballista
to Farel, who was loudly calling for labourers in Christ's
vineyard. The fine language of the Parisian at first charmed
the multitude; but it was soon found necessary to beware
of these priests and monks disgusted with Popery. "Brought
up in the slothfulness of the cloister, gluttonous and lazy,"
says Farel, "Ballista could not conform to the abstemiousness
and rude labours of the Evangelists, and soon began to
regret his monk's hood. When he perceived the people
beginning to distrust him, he became like a furious monster,
vomiting waggon-loads of threats."<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> Thus ended his labours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STATE&mdash;RELIGION.</div>

<p>Notwithstanding all these trials, Farel was not discouraged.
The greater the difficulties, the more his energy increased.
"Let us scatter the seed everywhere," said he, "and let
civilized France, provoked to jealousy by this barbarous
nation, embrace piety at last. Let there not be in Christ's
body either fingers, or hands, or feet, or eyes, or ears, or arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
existing separately and working each for itself, but let there
be only one heart that nothing can divide. Let not variety
in secondary things divide into many separate members that
vital principle which is one and simple.<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> Alas! the pastures
of the Church are trodden under foot, and its waters are
troubled! Let us set our minds to concord and peace.
When the Lord shall have opened heaven, there will not be
so many disputes about bread and water.<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> A fervent charity&mdash;that
is the powerful battering-ram with which we shall
beat down those proud walls, those material elements, with
which men would confine us."<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a></p>

<p>Thus wrote the most impetuous of the Reformers. These
words of Farel, preserved for three centuries in the city
where he died, disclose to us more clearly the intimate nature
of the great Revolution of the sixteenth century, than all the
venturesome assertions of its Popish interpreters. Christian
unity thus from these earliest moments found a zealous apostle.
The nineteenth century is called to resume the work
which the sixteenth century was unable to accomplish.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<div class="sidenote">IRRESOLUTION OF BERNE.</div>

<p>II. Of all the Swiss cantons, Berne appeared the least disposed
to the Reformation. A military state may be zealous
for religion, but it will be for an external and a disciplined
religion; it requires an ecclesiastical organization that it can
see, and touch, and manage at its will. It fears the innovations
and the free movements of the Word of God: it loves
the form and not the life. Napoleon, by restoring religion in
France in the <i>Concordat</i>, has given us a memorable example
of this truth. Such, also, was the case with Berne. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
government, besides, was absorbed by political interests, and
although it had little regard for the Pope, it cared still less to
see a Reformer put himself, as Zwingle did, at the head of
public affairs. As for the people, feasting on the "butter of
their kine and milk of their sheep, with fat of lambs,"<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> they
remained closely shut up within the narrow circle of their
material wants. Religious questions were not to the taste
either of the rulers or of their fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>The Bernese government, being without experience in
religious matters, had proposed to check the movement of the
Reform by its edict of 1523. As soon as it discovered its
mistake, it moved towards the cantons that adhered to the
ancient faith; and while that portion of the people whence
the Great Council was recruited, listened to the voice of
the Reformers, most of the patrician families, who composed
the Smaller Council, believing their power, their interests,
and their honor menaced, attached themselves to the old
order of things. From this opposition of the two councils
there arose a general uneasiness, but no violent shocks. Sudden
movements, repeated starts, announced from time to time
that incongruous matters were fermenting in the nation; it
was like an indistinct earthquake, which raises the whole
surface without causing any rents: then anon all returns to
apparent tranquillity.<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> Berne, which was always decided
in its politics, turned in religious matters at one time to the
right, and at another to the left; and declared that it would
be neither Popish nor Reformed. To gain time was, for the
new faith, to gain everything.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ALMANACK OF HERETICS.</div>

<p>What was done to turn aside Berne from the Reformation,
was the very cause of precipitating it into the new way.
The haughtiness with which the five primitive cantons arrogated
the guardianship of their confederates, the secret conferences
to which Berne was not even invited, and the threat
of addressing the people in a direct manner, deeply offended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the Bernese oligarchs. Thomas Murner, a Carmelite of Lucerne,
one of those rude men who act upon the populace, but
who inspire disgust in elevated minds, made the cup run over.
Furious against the Zurich calendar, in which the names of
the saints had been purposely omitted, he published in opposition
to it the "Almanack of Heretics and Church-robbers,"
a tract filled with lampoons and invectives, in which the
portraits of the Reformers and of their adherents, among
whom were many of the most considerable men of Berne,
were coupled with the most brutal inscriptions.<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> Zurich
and Berne in conjunction demanded satisfaction, and from
this time the union of these two states daily became closer.</p>

<p>This change was soon perceived at Berne. The elections
of 1527 placed a considerable number of friends of the Reform
in the Great Council; and this body, forthwith resuming
its right to nominate the members of the Smaller Council,
which had been usurped for twenty years by the Bannerets
and the Sixteen, removed from the government the most
decided partisans of the Roman hierarchy, and among others
Gaspard de Mulinen and Sebastian de Stein,<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> and filled the
vacancies with members of the Evangelical majority. The
union of Church and State, which had hitherto checked
the progress of the Reform in Switzerland, was now about to
accelerate its movements.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANABAPTISTS IN BERNE.</div>

<p>The Reformer Haller was not alone in Berne. Kolb had
quitted the Carthusian monastery at Nuremberg, in which
he had been compelled to take refuge, and had appeared
before his compatriots, demanding no other stipend than the
liberty of preaching Jesus Christ. Already bending under
the weight of years, his head crowned with hoary locks,
Kolb, young in heart, full of fire, and of indomitable courage,
presented boldly before the chiefs of the nation that Gospel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
which had saved him. Haller, on the contrary, although only
thirty-five years old, moved with a measured step, spoke
with gravity, and proclaimed the new doctrines with unusual
circumspection. The old man had taken the young man's
part, and the youth that of the graybeard.</p>

<p>Zwingle, whose eye nothing escaped, saw that a favourable
hour for Berne was coming, and immediately gave the
signal. "The dove commissioned to examine the state of
the waters is returning with an olive-branch into the ark,"
wrote he to Haller; "come forth now, thou second Noah,
and take possession of the land. Enforce, be earnest, and
fix deeply in the hearts of men the hooks and grapnels of the
Word of God, so that they can never again be rid of
them."<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a>&mdash;"Your bears," wrote he to Thomas ab Hofen,
"have again put forth their claws. Please God that they do
not draw them back until they have torn everything in
pieces that opposes Jesus Christ."</p>

<div class="sidenote">VICTORY OF THE GOSPEL.</div>

<p>Haller and his friends were on the point of replying to this
appeal, when their situation became complicated. Some
Anabaptists, who formed everywhere the extreme party, arriving
in Berne in 1527, led away the people from the Evangelical
preachers "on account of the presence of idols."<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a>
Haller had a useless conference with them. "To what
dangers is not Christianity exposed," cried he, "wherever
these furies have crept in!"<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> There has never been any revival
in the Church, without the hierarchical or radical sects
immediately endeavouring to disturb it. Haller, although
alarmed, still maintained his unalterable meekness. "The
magistrates are desirous of banishing them," said he; "but
it is our duty to drive out their errors, and not their persons.
Let us employ no other weapons than the sword of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Spirit."<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> It was not from Popery that the Reformers had
learnt these principles. A public disputation took place.
Six Anabaptists declared themselves convinced, and two
others were sent out of the country.</p>

<p>The decisive moment was drawing near. The two
great powers of the age, the Gospel and the Papacy, were stirring
with equal energy; the Bernese councils were to speak
out. They saw on the one hand the five primitive cantons
taking daily a more threatening attitude, and announcing
that the Austrian would soon reappear in Helvetia, to reduce
it once more into subjection to Rome; and on the other they
beheld the Gospel every day gaining ground in the Confederation.
Which was destined to prevail in Switzerland&mdash;the
lances of Austria or the Word of God? In the uncertainty
in which the councils were placed, they resolved to side
with the majority. Where could they discover a firm footing,
if not there? <i>Vox populi, vox Dei.</i> "No one," said they,
"can make any change of his own private authority: the
consent of all is necessary."<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a></p>

<p>The government of Berne had to decide between two mandates,
both emanating from its authority: that of 1523, in
favour of the free preaching of the Gospel, and that of 1526,
in favour "of the sacraments, the saints, the mother of God,
and the ornaments of the churches." State messengers set
out and traversed every parish: the people gave their votes
against every law contrary to liberty, and the councils, supported
by the nation, decreed that "the Word of God should
be preached publicly and freely, even if it should be in opposition
to the statutes and doctrines of men." Such was the
victory of the Gospel and of the people over the oligarchy and
the priests.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PAPIST PROVOCATIONS.</div>

<p>Contentions immediately arose throughout the canton, and
every parish became a battle-field. The peasants began to
dispute with the priests and monks, in reliance on the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Scriptures. "If the mandate of our lords," said many,
"accords to our pastors the liberty of preaching, why should
it not grant the flock the liberty of acting?"&mdash;"Peace,
peace!" cried the councils, alarmed at their own boldness.
But the flocks resolutely declared that they would send away
the Mass, and keep their pastors and the Bible.<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> Upon this
the Papal partisans grew violent. "Heretics, rascals, wantons,"
said the banneret Kuttler<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> to the good people of Emmenthal;
and these peasants obliged him to make an apology.
The bailiff of Trachselwald was more cunning. Seeing the
inhabitants of Rudersweil listening with eagerness to the
Word of God, which a pious minister was preaching to them,
he came with fifers and trumpeters, and interrupted the
sermon, inviting the village girls by words and by lively
tunes to quit the church for the dance.</p>

<p>These singular provocations did not check the Reform.
Six of the city companies (the shoe-makers, weavers, merchants,
bakers, stone-masons, and carpenters) abolished in the
churches and convents of their district all masses, anniversaries,
advowsons, and prebends. Three others (the tanners,
smiths, and tailors) prepared to imitate them;<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> the seven
remaining companies were undecided, except the butchers,
who were enthusiasts for the Pope. Thus the majority of the
citizens had embraced the Gospel. Many parishes throughout
the canton had done the same; and the avoyer d'Erlach,
the great adversary of the Reformation, could no longer keep
the torrent within bounds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROPOSED DISPUTATION.</div>

<p>Yet the attempt was made: the bailiffs were ordered to note
the irregularities and dissolute lives of the monks and nuns;
all women of loose morals were even turned out of the
cloisters.<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> But it was not against these abuses alone that the
Reformation was levelled; it was against the institutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
themselves, and against Popery on which they were founded.
The people must therefore decide.&mdash;"The Bernese clergy,"
said they, "must be convoked, as at Zurich, and let the two
doctrines be discussed in a solemn conference. We will
proceed afterwards in conformity with the result."</p>

<p>On the Sunday following the festival of Saint Martin
(11th November), the council and citizens unanimously resolved
that a public disputation should take place at the beginning
of the succeeding year. "The glory of God and his
Word," said they, "will at length appear!" Bernese and
strangers, priests and laymen, all were invited by letter or by
printed notice to come and discuss the controverted points,
but by Scripture alone, without the glosses of the ancients,
and renouncing all subtleties and abusive language.<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> Who
knows, said they, if all the members of the ancient Swiss
confederation may not be thus brought to unity of faith?</p>

<p>Thus, within the walls of Berne, the struggle was about
to take place that would decide the fate of Switzerland; for
the example of the Bernese must necessarily lead with it a
great part of the Confederation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IMPORTANT QUESTION.</div>

<p>The Five Cantons, alarmed at this intelligence, met at
Lucerne, when they were joined by Fribourg, Soleure and
Glaris. There was nothing either in the letter or in the spirit
of the federal compact to obstruct religious liberty. "Every
state," said Zurich, "is free to choose the doctrine that it
desires to profess." The Waldstettes,<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> on the contrary,
wished to deprive the cantons of this independence, and to
subject them to the federal majority and to the Pope. They
protested, therefore, in the name of the confederation against
the proposed discussion. "Your ministers," wrote they to
Berne, "dazzled and confounded at Baden by the brightness
of truth, would desire by this new discussion to hide their
shame; but we entreat you to desist from a plan so contrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
to our ancient alliances."&mdash;"It is not we who have infringed
them," replied Berne; "it is much rather your haughty
missive that has destroyed them. We will not abandon the
Word of our Lord Jesus Christ." Upon this the Roman cantons
decided to refuse all safe-conduct to those who should
proceed to Berne. This was giving token of sinister intentions.</p>

<p>The four bishops of Lausanne, Constance, Basle, and Sion,
being invited to the conference under pain of forfeiting all
their privileges in the canton of Berne, replied that, since it
was to be a disputation according to the Scriptures, they had
nothing to do with it. Thus did these priests forget the
words of one of the most illustrious Roman doctors of the
fifteenth century: "In heavenly things man should be independent
of his fellows, and trust in God alone."<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a></p>

<p>The Romanist doctors followed the example of the bishops.
Eck, Murner, Cochl&oelig;us, and many others said everywhere:
"We have received the letter of this leper, of this accursed
heretic Zwingle.<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> They want to take the Bible for their
judge; but has the Bible a voice against those who do it
violence? We will not go to Berne; we will not crawl
into that obscure corner of the world; we will not go and
combat in that gloomy cavern, in that school of heretics. Let
these villains come out into the open air, and contend with
us on level ground, if they have the Bible on their side, as
they say." The Emperor ordered the discussion to be adjourned;
but on the very day of its opening, the council of
Berne replied, that as every one was already assembled,
delay was impossible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">UNEQUAL CONTEST.</div>

<p>Then, in despite of the doctors and bishops, the Helvetic
Church assembled to decide upon its doctrines. Had it a
right to do so? No;&mdash;not if priests and bishops were appointed,
as Rome pretends, to form a mystic bond between the
Church and our Lord; Yes&mdash;if they were established, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
the Bible declares, only to satisfy that law of order by virtue
of which all society should have a directing power. The
opinions of the Swiss Reformers in this respect were not
doubtful. The grace which creates the minister comes from
the Lord, thought they; but the Church examines this grace,
acknowledges it, proclaims it by the elders, and in every act
in which faith is concerned, it can always appeal from the
minister to the Word of God. <i>Try the spirits&mdash;prove all
things</i>, it says to the faithful. The Church is the judge of
controversies;<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> and it is this duty, in which it should never
be found wanting, that it was now about to fulfil in the disputation
at Berne.</p>

<p>The contest seemed unequal. On one side appeared the
Roman hierarchy, a giant which had increased in strength
during many centuries; and on the other, there was at first
but one weak and timid man, the modest Berthold Haller. "I
cannot wield the sword of the Word," said he in alarm to his
friends. "If you do not stretch out your hands to me, all is
over." He then threw himself trembling at the feet of the
Lord, and soon arose enlightened and exclaiming, "Faith in
the Saviour gives me courage, and scatters all my fears."<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a></p>

<p>Yet he could not remain alone: all his looks were turned
towards Zwingle: "It was I who took the bath at Baden," wrote
&OElig;colampadius to Haller, "and now it is Zwingle who should
lead off the bear-dance in Berne."<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a>&mdash;"We are between the
hammer and the anvil," wrote Haller to Zwingle; "we hold
the wolf by the ears, and know not how to let him go.<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a>
The houses of De Watteville, Noll, Tremp, and Berthold are
open to you. Come, then, and command the battle in person."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A CHRISTIAN BAND.</div>

<p>Zwingle did not hesitate. He demanded permission of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Council of Zurich to visit Berne, in order to show there "that
his teaching was full of the fear of God, and not blasphemous;
mighty to spread concord through Switzerland, and
not to cause troubles and dissension."<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> At the very time
that Haller received news of Zwingle's coming, &OElig;colampadius
wrote to him: "I am ready, if it be necessary, to sacrifice
my life. Let us inaugurate the new year by embracing
one another to the glory of Jesus Christ." Other doctors
wrote to the same effect. "These, then," cried Haller with
emotion, "these are the auxiliaries that the Lord sends to my
infirmity, to aid me in fighting this rude battle!"</p>

<p>It was necessary to proceed with circumspection, for the
violence of the oligarchs and of the Five Cantons was well
known.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> The doctors of Glaris, Schaffhausen, St. Gall,
Constance, Ulm, Lindau and Augsburg, assembled at Zurich,
to proceed under the same escort as Zwingle, Pellican, Collin,
Megander, Grossman, the commander Schmidt, Bullinger,
and a great number of the rural clergy, selected to accompany
the reformer. "When all this game traverses the
country," said the pensioners, "we will go a-hunting, and
see if we cannot kill some, or at least catch them and put
them into a cage."</p>

<p>Three hundred chosen men, selected from the companies
of Zurich and from the parishes within its precincts, donned
their breastplates and shouldered their arquebuses; but in
order not to give the journey of these doctors the appearance
of a military expedition, they took neither colours, fife, nor
drum; and the trumpeter of the city, a civil officer, rode
alone at the head of the company.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OPENING OF THE CONFERENCE.</div>

<p>On Tuesday the 2d of January they set out. Never had
Zwingle appeared more cheerful. "Glory be to the Lord,"
said he, "my courage increases every day."<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> The burgomaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Roust, the town-clerk of Mangoldt, with Funck and
Jaëkli, both masters of arts, and all four delegated by the
council, were on horseback near him. They reached Berne
on the 4th of January, having had only one or two unimportant
alarms.</p>

<p>The Cordeliers' Church was to serve as the place of conference.
Tillmann, the city architect, had made arrangements
according to a plan furnished by Zwingle.<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> A large
platform had been erected on which were placed two tables,
and around them sat the champions of the two parties.
On the evangelical side were remarked, besides Haller,
Zwingle, and &OElig;colampadius, many distinguished men of the
Reformed Church, strangers to Switzerland, as Bucer, Capito,
and Ambrose Blarer. On the side of the papacy, Dr.
Treger of Friburg, who enjoyed a high reputation, appeared
to keep up the fire of the combat. As for the rest, whether
through fear or contempt, the most famous Roman doctors
were absent.</p>

<p>The first act was to publish the regulations of the conference.
"No proof shall be proposed that is not drawn
from the Holy Scriptures, and no explanation shall be given
of those scriptures, that does not come from Scripture itself,
explaining obscure texts by such as are clear." After this,
one of the secretaries, rising to call over the roll, shouted
with a loud voice that re-echoed through the church,&mdash;The
Bishop of Constance! No one replied. He did the same for
the bishops of Zion, Basle, and Lausanne. Neither of these
prelates was present at this meeting, either in person or by
deputy. The Word of God being destined to reign alone,
the Roman hierarchy did not appear. These two powers
cannot walk together. There were present about three hundred
and fifty Swiss and German ecclesiastics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRIST, THE SOLE HEAD.</div>

<p>On Tuesday, 7th January, 1528, the burgomaster Vadianus,
of St. Gall, one of the presidents, opened the disputation.
After him the aged Kolb stood up, and said: "God is at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
this moment agitating the whole world, let us, therefore,
humble ourselves before him," and he pronounced with fervour
a confession of sins.</p>

<p>When this was done, the first thesis was read. It was
thus drawn up. "The Holy Christian Church, of which
Christ is the sole head, is born of the Word of God, abideth
in it, and listeneth not to the voice of a stranger."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexis Grat</span>, a Dominican monk,&mdash;"The word <i>sole</i> is
not in Scripture. Christ has left a vicar here below."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Haller.</span>&mdash;"The vicar that Christ left is the Holy Ghost."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treger.</span>&mdash;"See then to what a pass things have come
these last ten years. This man calls himself a Lutheran,
that a Zwinglian; a third, a Carlstadtian; a fourth an &OElig;colampadist;
a fifth, an Anabaptist......"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bucer.</span>&mdash;"Whosoever preacheth Jesus as the only Saviour,
we recognize as our brother. Neither Luther, nor
Zwingle, nor &OElig;colampadius, desires the faithful to bear his
name. Besides, you should not boast so much of a mere
external unity. When antichrist gained the upperhand
throughout the world, in the East by Mahomet, in the West
by the Pope, he was able to keep the people in unity of error.
God permits divisions, in order that those who belong to him
may learn to look not to men, but to the testimony of the
Word, and to the assurance of the Holy Ghost in their hearts.
Thus then, dearly beloved brethren, to the Scriptures, the
Scriptures!<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> O Church of Berne, hold fast to the teaching
of Him who said, <i>Come unto me</i>, and not, <i>Come unto my vicar</i>!"</p>

<p>The disputation then turned successively on Tradition,
the Merits of Christ, Transubstantiation, the Mass, Prayer to
the Saints, Purgatory, Images, Celibacy, and the Disorders of
the Clergy. Rome found numerous defenders, and among
others, Murer, priest of Rapperswyl, who had said: "If
they wish to burn the two ministers of Berne, I will undertake
to carry them both to the stake."</p>

<div class="sidenote">REMARKABLE CONVERSION.</div>

<p>On Sunday, the 19th of January the day on which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
doctrine of the Mass was attacked, Zwingle, desirous of acting
on the people also, went into the pulpit, and reciting the
Apostles' Creed, made a pause after these words: "He
ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God the
Father Almighty; from thence he shall come to judge the
quick and the dead." "These three articles," said he, "are
in contradiction to the Mass." All his hearers redoubled
their attention; and a priest, clothed in his sacerdotal vestments;
who was preparing to celebrate the holy sacrifice in
one of the chapels, stopped in astonishment at Zwingle's
words. Erect before the consecrated altar on which lay
the chalice and the body of the Saviour, with eyes fixed upon
the reformer, whose words electrified the people, a prey to
the most violent struggles, and beaten down by the weight
of truth, the agitated priest resolved to sacrifice every thing
for it. In the presence of the whole assembly, he stripped
off his priestly ornaments, and throwing them on the altar, he
exclaimed: "Unless the Mass reposes on a more solid foundation,
I can celebrate it no longer!" The noise of this conversion,
effected at the very foot of the altar, immediately
spread through the city,<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> and it was regarded as an important
omen. So long as the Mass remains, Rome has gained
everything: as soon as the Mass falls, Rome has lost all.
The Mass is the creative principle of the whole system of
Popery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ST. VINCENT'S DAY.</div>

<p>Three days later, on the 22d January, was the feast of St.
Vincent, the patron of the city. The disputation that had
been carried on during Sunday was suspended on that day.
The canons asked the council what they were to do. "Such
of you," replied the council, "as receive the doctrine of the
theses ought not to say Mass; the others may perform
divine worship as usual."<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> Every preparation was accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
made for the solemnity. On St. Vincent's eve the
bells from every steeple announced the festival to the inhabitants
of Berne. On the morrow the sacristans lit up the
tapers; incense filled the temple, but no one appeared. No
priests to say Mass, no faithful to hear it! Already there
was a vast chasm in the Roman sanctuary, a deep silence,
as on the field of battle, where none but the dead are
lying.</p>

<p>In the evening it was the custom for the canons to chaunt
vespers with great pomp. The organist was at his post, but
no one else appeared. The poor man left thus alone, beholding
with sorrow the fall of that worship by which he
gained his bread, gave utterance to his grief by playing a
mourning-hymn instead of the majestic <i>Magnificat</i>: "Oh,
wretched Judas, what hast thou done, that thou hast thus
betrayed our Lord?" After this sad farewell, he rose and
went out. Almost immediately, some men, excited by the
passions of the moment, fell upon his beloved organ, an
accomplice in their eyes of so many superstitious rites, and
their violent hands broke it to pieces. No more Mass, no
more organ, no more anthems! A new Supper and new
hymns shall succeed the rites of Popery.</p>

<p>On the next day there was the same silence. Suddenly,
however, a band of men with loud voices and hasty steps was
heard. It was the Butchers' Company that, at this moment
so fatal to Rome, desired to support it. They advanced,
carrying small fir-trees and green branches, for the decoration
of their chapel. In the midst of them was a foreign priest,
behind whom walked a few poor scholars. The priest officiated;
the sweet voices of the scholars supplied the place of
the mute organ, and the butchers retired proud of their victory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PAPIST BITTERNESS.</div>

<p>The discussion was drawing to a close: the combatants had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
dealt vigorous blows. Burgauer, pastor of St. Gall, had
maintained the real presence in the Host; but on the 19th
January he declared himself convinced by the reasonings of
Zwingle, &OElig;colampadius, and Bucer; and Matthias, minister
of Saengen, had done the same.</p>

<p>A conference in Latin afterwards took place between Farel
and a Parisian doctor. The latter advanced a strange argument.
"Christians," said he, "are enjoined to obey the
devil;<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> for it is said, <i>Submit unto thine adversary</i> (Matt. v.
25); now, our adversary is the devil. How much more,
then, should we submit to the Church!" Loud bursts of
laughter greeted this remarkable syllogism. A discussion
with the Anabaptists terminated the conference.</p>

<p>The two councils decreed that the Mass should be abolished,
and that every one might remove from the churches the ornaments
he had placed there.</p>

<p>Immediately twenty-five altars and a great number of
images were destroyed in the cathedral, yet without disorder
or bloodshed; and the children began to sing in the streets
(as Luther informs us):<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">From a God in a mortar brayed.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">NECESSITY OF REFORM.</div>

<p>The hearts of the adherents of the Papacy were filled with
bitterness as they heard the objects of their adoration fall one
after another. "Should any man," said John Schneider,
"take away the altar of the Butchers' Company, I will take
away his life." Peter Thorman compared the cathedral
stripped of its ornaments to a stable. "When the good folks
of the Oberland come to market," added he, "they will be
happy to put up their cattle in it." And John Zehender,
member of the Great Council, to show the little value he set
on such a place of worship, entered it riding on an ass, insulting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
and cursing the Reform. A Bernese, who chanced
to be there, having said to him, "It is by God's will that
these images have been pulled down,"&mdash;"Say rather by the
devil's," replied Zehender; "when have you ever been with
God so as to learn his will?" He was fined twenty livres,
and expelled from the council.<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> "What times! what manners!"
exclaimed many; "what culpable neglect! How
easy would it have been to prevent so great a misfortune!
Oh! if our bishops had only been willing to occupy themselves
more with learning and a little less with their mistresses!"<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a></p>

<p>This Reform was necessary. When Christianity in the
fourth century had seen the favour of princes succeed to persecution,
a crowd of heathens rushing into the church had
brought with them the images, pomps, statues, and demigods
of Paganism, and a likeness of the mysteries of Greece and
Asia, and above all of Egypt, had banished the Word of
Jesus Christ from the Christian oratories. This Word returning
in the sixteenth century, a purification must necessarily
take place; but it could not be done without grievous
rents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE'S SERMON.</div>

<p>The departure of the strangers was drawing near. On
the 28th January, the day after that on which the images
and altars had been thrown down, while their piled fragments
still encumbered here and there the porches and the aisles of
the cathedral, Zwingle crossing these eloquent ruins, once
more ascended the pulpit in the midst of an immense crowd.
In great emotion, directing his eyes by turns on these fragments
and on the people, he said: "Victory has declared for
the truth, but perseverance alone can complete the triumph.
Christ persevered even until death. <i>Ferendo vincitur fortuna.</i>
Cornelius Scipio, after the disaster at Cannæ, having learnt
that the generals surviving the slaughter meditated quitting
Italy, entered the senate-house, although not yet of senatorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
age, drew his sword, and constrained the affrighted chiefs to
swear that they would not abandon Rome. Citizens of Berne,
to you I address the same demand: do not abandon Jesus
Christ."</p>

<p>We may easily imagine the effect produced on the people
by such words, pronounced with Zwingle's energetic eloquence.</p>

<p>Then, turning towards the fragments that lay near him:
"Behold," said he, "behold these idols! Behold them conquered,
mute, and shattered before us! These corpses must
be dragged to the shambles, and the gold you have spent
upon these foolish images must henceforward be devoted to
comforting in their misery the living images of God. Feeble
souls, ye shed tears over these sad idols; do ye not see that
they break, do ye not hear that they crack like any other
wood, or like any other stone? Look! here is one deprived
of its head......(Zwingle pointed to the image, and all the people
fixed their eyes upon it); here is another maimed of its
arms.<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> If this ill usage had done any harm to the saints that
are in heaven, and if they had the power ascribed to them,
would you have been able, I pray, to cut off their arms and
their heads?"</p>

<p>"Now then," said the powerful orator in conclusion, "stand
fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has made you free, and
be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage (Gal. v. 1).
Fear not! That God who has enlightened you, will enlighten
your confederates also, and Switzerland, regenerated
by the Holy Ghost, shall flourish in righteousness and peace."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE TRIUMPHANT.</div>

<p>The words of Zwingle were not lost. The mercy of God
called forth that of man. Some persons condemned to die
for sedition, were pardoned, and all the exiles were recalled.
"Should we not have done so," said the council, "had a
great prince visited us? Shall we not much more do so,
now that the King of kings and the Redeemer of our souls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
has made his entry among us, bearing an everlasting amnesty?"<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a></p>

<p>The Romish cantons, exasperated at the result of the discussion,
sought to harass the return of the doctors. On
arriving before Bremgarten, they found the gates closed.
The bailiff Schutz, who had accompanied them with two
hundred men-at-arms, placed two halberdiers before Zwingle's
horse, two behind him, and one on each side; then
putting himself at the Reformer's left hand, while the burgomaster
Roust stationed himself on the right, he ordered the
escort to proceed, lance in rest.<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> The avoyers of the town
being intimidated, came to a parley; the gates were opened;
the escort traversed Bremgarten amidst an immense crowd,
and on the 1st February reached Zurich without accident,
which Zwingle re-entered, says Luther, like a conqueror.<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a></p>

<p>The Roman-catholic party did not dissemble the check
they had received. "Our cause is falling," said the friends
of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> "Oh! that we had had men skilled in the Bible!
The impetuosity of Zwingle supported our adversaries; his
ardour was never relaxed. That brute has more knowledge
than was imagined.<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> Alas! alas! the greater party has vanquished
the better."<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a></p>

<p>The Council of Berne, desirous of separating from the
Pope, relied upon the people. On the 30th January, messengers
going from house to house convoked the citizens;
and on the 2d February, the burgesses and inhabitants,
masters and servants, uniting in the cathedral, and forming
but one family, with hands upraised to heaven, swore to defend
the two councils in all they should undertake for the
good of the State or of the Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EDICT OF REFORM.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>On the 7th February 1528, the council published a general
edict of Reform, and "threw for ever from the necks of the
Bernese the yoke of the four bishops, who," said they, "know
well how to shear their sheep, but not how to feed them."<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a></p>

<p>At the same time the Reformed doctrines were spreading
among the people. In every quarter might be heard earnest
and keen dialogues, written in rhyme by Manuel, in which
the pale and expiring Mass, stretched on her deathbed, was
loudly calling for all her physicians, and finding their advice
useless, at last dictating with a broken voice her last will
and testament, which the people received with loud bursts of
laughter.</p>

<p>The Reformation generally, and that of Berne in particular,
has been reproached as being brought about by political
motives. But, on the contrary, Berne, which of all the
Helvetic states was the greatest favourite of the court of
Rome&mdash;which had in its canton neither a bishop to dismiss nor
a powerful clergy to humiliate&mdash;Berne, whose most influential
families, the Weingartens, Manuels, Mays, were reluctant
to sacrifice the pay and the service of the foreigner, and
all whose traditions were conservative, ought to have opposed
the movement. The Word of God was the power that overcame
this political tendency.<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE REFORM ACCEPTED.</div>

<p>At Berne, as elsewhere, it was neither a learned, nor a
democratic, nor a sectarian spirit that gave birth to the Reformation.
Undoubtedly the men of letters, the liberals, the
sectarian enthusiasts, rushed into the great struggle of the
sixteenth century; but the duration of the Reform would not
have been long had it received its life from them. The
primitive strength of Christianity, reviving after ages of
long and complete prostration, was the creative principle of
the Reformation; and it was erelong seen to separate distinctly
from the false allies that had presented themselves, to
reject an incredulous learning by elevating the study of the
classics, to check all demagogic anarchy by upholding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
principles of true liberty, and to repudiate the enthusiastic
sects by consecrating the rights of the Word and of the
christian people.</p>

<p>But while we maintain that the Reformation was at Berne,
as elsewhere, a truly christian work, we are far from saying
that it was not useful to the canton in a political sense. All
the European states that have embraced the Reformation
have been elevated, while those which have combated it have
been lowered.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>III. It now became a question of propagating throughout
all the canton the reform accomplished in the city. On the
17th February, the council invited the rural parishes to
assemble on the following Sunday to receive and deliberate
upon a communication. The whole Church, according to the
ancient usage of Christendom, was about to decide for itself
on its dearest interests.</p>

<p>The assemblies were crowded; all conditions and ages
were present. Beside the hoary and the trembling head of
the aged man might be seen the sparkling eye of the youthful
shepherd. The messengers of the council first read the
edict of the Reformation. They next proclaimed that those
who accepted it should remain, and that those who rejected
it should withdraw.</p>

<p>Almost all the assembled parishioners remained in their
places. An immense majority of the people chose the Bible.
In some few parishes this decision was accompanied with
energetic demonstrations. At Arberg, Zofingen, Brugg,
Arau, and Buren, the images were burnt. "At Stauffberg,"
it was said, "idols were seen carrying idols, and throwing

<p>The images and the Mass had disappeared from this vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
canton. "A great cry resounded far and wide," writes Bullinger.<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a>
In one day Rome had fallen throughout the country,
without treachery, violence, or seduction, by the strength
of truth alone. In some places, however, in the Hasli, at
Frutigen, Unterseen, and Grindelwald, the malcontents were
heard to say: "If they abolish the Mass, they should also
abolish tithes." The Roman form of worship was preserved
in the Upper Simmenthal, a proof that there was no compulsion
on the part of the state.</p>

<p>The wishes of the canton being thus manifested, Berne
completed the Reformation. All excesses in gambling, drinking,
and dancing, and all unbecoming dress, were forbidden
by proclamation. The houses of ill-fame were destroyed,
and their wretched inhabitants expelled from the city.<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> A
consistory was appointed to watch over the public morals.</p>

<p>Seven days after the edict, the poor were received into the
Dominican cloister, and a little later the convent of the
Island was changed into an hospital; the princely monastery
of Königsfield was also devoted to the same useful purpose.
Charity followed everywhere in the steps of faith. "We will
show," said the council, "that we do not use the property of
the convents to our own advantage;" and they kept their
word. The poor were clothed with the priests' garments;
the orphans were decorated with the ornaments of the
Church. So strict were they in these distributions, that the
state was forced to borrow money to pay the annuities of the
monks and nuns; and for eight days there was not a crown
in the public treasury.<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> Thus it was that the State, as it
has been continually repeated, grew rich with the spoils of
the Church! At the same time they invited from Zurich the
ministers Hoffmeister, Megander, and Rhellican, to spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
throughout the canton the knowledge of the classics and of
the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FIRST EVANGELICAL COMMUNION.</div>

<p>At Easter the Lord's Supper was celebrated for the first
time according to the Evangelical rites. The two councils
and all the people, with few exceptions, partook of it.
Strangers were struck with the solemnity of this first communion.
The citizens of Berne and their wives, dressed in
decent garments, which recalled the ancient Swiss simplicity,
approached Christ's table with gravity and fervour;<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> the
heads of the state showed the same holy devotion as the people,
and piously received the bread from the hands of Berthold
Haller. Each one felt that the Lord was among them.
Thus Hoffmeister, charmed at this solemn service, exclaimed:
"How can the adversaries of the Word refuse to embrace
the truth at last, seeing that God himself renders it so striking
a testimony!"<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a></p>

<p>Yet everything was not changed. The friends of the Gospel
witnessed with pain the sons of the chief families of the
republic parading the streets in costly garments, inhabiting
sumptuous houses in the city, dwelling in magnificent mansions
in the country&mdash;true seignorial abodes, following the
chase with hound and horn, sitting down to luxurious banquets,
conversing in licentious language, or talking with
enthusiasm of foreign wars and of the French party. "Ah!"
said that pious people, "could we but see old Switzerland
revive with its old virtues!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">HEAD OF BEATUS.</div>

<p>There was soon a powerful reaction. The annual renewal
of the magistrature being about to take place, the councillor
Butschelbach, a violent adversary of the Gospel, was ejected
for adultery; four other senators and twenty members of
the Great Council were also replaced by friends of the Reformation
and of public morality. Emboldened by this victory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
the Evangelical Bernese proposed in the diet that every
Swiss should renounce foreign service. At these words the
warriors of Lucerne started under their weighty armour, and
replied with a haughty smile: "When you have returned
to the ancient faith we will listen to your homilies." All the
members of the government, assembled at Berne in sovereign
council, resolved to set the example, and solemnly abjured
the pay of foreign princes. Thus the Reformation showed
its faith by its works.</p>

<p>Another struggle took place. Above the lake of Thunn
rises a chain of steep rocks, in the midst of which is situated
a deep cavern, where, if we may believe tradition, the pious
Breton, Beatus, came in ancient times to devote himself to
all the austerities of an ascetic life; but especially to the
conversion of the surrounding district that was still heathen.
It was affirmed that the head of this saint, who had died in
Gaul, was preserved in this cavern; and hence it was visited
by pilgrims from every quarter. The pious citizens of Zug,
Schwytz, Uri, and Argovia, groaned, as they thought that the
holy head of the apostle of Switzerland would hereafter
remain in a land of heretics. The abbot of the celebrated
convent of Muri in Argovia and some of his friends set out,
as in ancient times the Argonauts went in quest of the
Golden Fleece. They arrived in the humble guise of poor
pilgrims, and entered the cavern; one skilfully took away
the head, another placed it mysteriously in his hood, and they
disappeared. The head of a dead man!&mdash;and this was all
that Rome saved from the shipwreck. But even this conquest
was more than doubtful. The Bernese, who had gained
information of this procession, sent three deputies on the 18th
May, who, according to their report, found this famous head,
and caused it to be decently interred before their eyes in the
cemetery belonging to the convent of Interlaken. This contest
about a skull characterizes the Church that had just
given way in Berne before the vivifying breath of the Gospel.
<i>Let the dead bury their dead.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">THREATENING STORM.</div>

<p>The Reformation had triumphed in Berne; but a storm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
was gathering unperceived in the mountains, which threatened
to overthrow it. The State in union with the Church recalled
its ancient renown. Seeing itself attacked by arms, it took
up arms in its turn, and acted with that decision which had
formerly saved Rome in similar dangers.</p>

<p>A secret discontent was fermenting among the people
of the valleys and mountains. Some were still attached to
the ancient faith; others had only quitted the Mass because
they thought they would be exempted from tithes. Ancient
ties of neighbourhood, a common origin, and similarity of
manners had united the inhabitants of the Obwald (Unterwalden)
to those of the Hasli and of the Bernese Oberland, which
were separated only by Mount Brunig and the high pass of
the Yoke. A rumour had been set afloat that the government
of Berne had profaned the spot where the precious remains
of Beatus, the apostle of these mountains, were preserved,
and indignation immediately filled these pastoral people,
who adhere firmer than others to the customs and superstitions
of their forefathers.</p>

<p>But while some were excited by attachment to Rome,
others were aroused by a desire for liberty. The subjects of
the monastery of Interlaken, oppressed by the monkish rule,
began to cry out, "We desire to become our own masters,
and no longer pay rent or tithes." The provost of the convent
in affright ceded all his rights to Berne for the sum of
one hundred thousand florins;<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> and a bailiff, accompanied
by several councillors, went and took possession of the monastery.
A report was soon spread that they were about to
transfer all the property of the convent to Berne; and on
the 21st of April bands of men from Grindelwald, Lauterbrunnen,
Ringelberg, Brienz, and other places, crossed the
lake, or issued from their lofty valleys, and taking forcible
possession of the cloister, swore to go even to Berne in quest
of the goods which the citizens had dared to take from them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REVOLT.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>They were quieted for a time; but in the beginning of
June, the people, at the instigation of Unterwalden, again
arose in all the Hasli. The Landsgemeinde<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> having been
convoked, it decided by a majority of forty voices for the
re-establishment of the Mass. The pastor Jaëkli was immediately
expelled; a few men crossed the Brunig, and brought
back some priests from Unterwalden, to the sound of fifes
and trumpets. They were seen from afar descending the
mountain, and shouts, both loud and long, replied to them
from the bottom of the valley. At last they arrived:&mdash;all
embraced one another, and the people celebrated the Mass
anew with great demonstrations of joy. At the same time, the
people of Frutigen and of the fertile valley of Adelboden
assailed the castellan Reuter, carried off his flocks, and established
a Roman-catholic priest in the place of their pastor.
At Aeschi even the women took up arms, drove out the
pastor from the church, and brought back the images in
triumph. The revolt spread from hamlet to hamlet and from
valley to valley, and again took possession of Interlaken. All
the malcontents assembled there on the 22d October, and
swore, with hands upraised to heaven, boldly to defend their
rights and liberty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRIST IN DANGER.</div>

<p>Never, perhaps, had the republic been in greater danger.
All the kings of Europe, and almost all the cantons of
Switzerland, were opposed to the Gospel. The report of an
army from Austria, destined to interpose in favour of the
Pope, spread through the Reformed cantons.<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> Seditious
meetings took place every day,<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> and the people refused to
pay their magistrates either quit-rent, service, tithes, or
even obedience, unless they shut their eyes to the designs of
the Roman-catholics. The council became confused. Amazed
and confounded, exposed to the mistrust of some and to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
insults of others, they had the cowardice to separate under
the pretext of getting in the vintage, and folding their arms,
in the presence of this great danger, waited until a Messiah
should descend from heaven (says a reformer) to save the
republic.<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> The ministers pointed out the danger, forewarned
and conjured them; but each one turned a deaf
ear. "Christ languishes in Berne," said Haller, "and appears
nigh perishing."<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> The people were all in commotion;
they assembled, made speeches, murmured, and shed tears!
Everywhere&mdash;in all their tumultuous meetings&mdash;might be
heard this complaint of Manuel on Papists and the Papacy:<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With rage our foes their hateful threats denounce,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Because, O Lord, we love Thee best of all;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Because at sight of Thee the idols fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And war and bloodshed, shuddering, we renounce.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Berne was like a troubled sea, and Haller, who listened
to the roaring of the waves, wrote in the deepest anguish:
"Wisdom has forsaken the wise, counsel has departed from
the councillors, and energy from the chiefs and from the
people! The number of the seditious augments every day.
Alas! what can the Bear, oppressed with sleep, oppose to so
many and to such sturdy hunters?<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> If Christ withdraw himself,
we shall all perish."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENERGY OF BERNE.</div>

<p>These fears were on the point of being realized. The
smaller cantons claimed to have the power of interfering in
matters of faith without infringing the federal compact. While
six hundred men of Uri kept themselves ready to depart,
eight hundred men of Unterwalden, bearing pine-branches in
their hats, symbols of the old faith, with haughty heads and
gloomy and angry looks, crossed the Brunig under the
ancient banner of the country, which was borne by Gaspard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
de Flue, a very unworthy grandson of the great Nicholas.<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a>
This was the first violation of the national peace for many
years. Uniting at Hasli with the men of Brienz, this little
army crossed the lake, passed under the cascades of Geisbach,
and arrived at Unterseen, thirteen hundred strong, and
ready to march on Berne to re-establish the Pope, the Idols,
and the Mass in that rebellious city. In Switzerland, as in
Germany, the Reformation at its outset met with a peasant
war. At the first success, new combatants would arrive and
pour through the passes of the Brunig upon the unfaithful
republic. The army was only six leagues from Berne, and
already the sons of Unterwalden were proudly brandishing
their swords on the banks of the lake of Thunn.</p>

<p>Thus were the federal alliances trodden under foot by those
very persons who aspired to the name of conservatives. Berne
had a right to repel this criminal attack by force. Suddenly
calling to mind her ancient virtues, the city roused herself,
and vowed to perish rather than tolerate the intervention of
Unterwalden, the restoration of the Mass, and the fiery
violence of the peasants.<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a> There was at that moment in the
hearts of the Bernese one of those inspirations that come from
above, and which save nations as well as individuals. "Let
the strength of the city of Berne," exclaimed the Avoyer d'Erlach,
"be in God alone, and in the loyalty of its people."
All the council and the whole body of the citizens replied by
noisy acclamations. The great banner was hastily brought
forth, the townspeople ran to arms, the companies assembled,
and the troops of the republic marched out with the valiant
avoyer at their head.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VICTORY.</div>

<p>Scarcely had the Bernese government acted thus energetically,
before it saw the confidence of its friends increase, and
the courage of its adversaries diminish. God never abandons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
a people who are true to themselves. Many of the Oberlanders
became intimidated, and deserted the ranks of the
revolt. At the same time deputies from Basle and Lucerne
represented to Unterwalden that it was trampling the ancient
alliances under foot. The rebels, disheartened by the firmness
of the republic, abandoned Unterseen, and retired to the
convent of Interlaken. And soon after, when they beheld
the decision of their adversaries, distressed besides by the
cold rains that fell incessantly, and fearing that the snow, by
covering the mountains, would prevent their return to their
homes, the men of Unterwalden evacuated Interlaken during
the night. The Bernese, to the number of five thousand men,
entered it immediately, and summoned the inhabitants of the
Hasli and of the bailiwick of Interlaken to assemble on the
4th November in the plain that surrounds the convent.<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> The
day being arrived, the Bernese army drew up in order of
battle, and then formed a circle within which D'Erlach
ordered the peasants to enter. Hardly had he placed the
rebels on the left and the loyal citizens on the right, before
the muskets and artillery fired a general discharge, whose
report re-echoing among the mountains, filled the insurgents
with terror, who thought it the signal of their death. But
the avoyer only intended to show they were in the power of
the republic. D'Erlach, who addressed them immediately
after this strange exordium, had not finished his speech, before
they all fell on their knees, and, confessing their crime, begged
for pardon. The republic was satisfied: the rebellion
was over. The banners of the district were carried to Berne,
and the Eagle of Interlaken, in union with the Wild-goat of
Hasli, hung for a time beneath the Bear, as a trophy of this
victory. Four of the chiefs were put to death, and an amnesty
was granted to the remainder of the rebels. "The
Bernese," said Zwingle, "as Alexander of Macedon in times
of old, have cut the Gordian knot with courage and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
glory."<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> Thus thought the Reformer of Zurich; but experience
was one day to teach him, that to cut such knots is
required a different sword from that of Alexander and of
D'Erlach. However that may be, peace was restored, and
in the valleys of the Hasli no other noise was heard than the
sublime tumult borne afar by the Reichenbach and all the
surrounding torrents, as they pour from the mountain-tops
their multitudinous and foaming waters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POLITICAL ADVANTAGES.</div>

<p>While we repudiate on behalf of the Church the swords of
the Helvetic bands, it would be unwise not to acknowledge
the political advantages of this victory. The nobles had
imagined that the Reformation of the Church would endanger
the very existence of the State. They now had a proof to
the contrary: they saw that when a nation receives the Gospel,
its strength is doubled. The generous confidence with
which, in the hour of danger, they had placed some of the
adversaries of the Reformation at the head of affairs and of
the army, produced the happiest results. All were now convinced
that the Reformation would not trample old recollections
under foot: prejudices were removed, hatred was
appeased, the Gospel gradually rallied all hearts around it,
and the ancient and remarkable saying was verified, which
was so often repeated by the friends and enemies of that
powerful republic&mdash;"God is become a citizen of Berne."</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>IV. The reformation of Berne was decisive for several
cantons. The same wind that had blown from on high with
so much power on the country of De Watteville and Haller,
threw down "the idols" in a great part of Switzerland. In
many places the people were indignant at seeing the Reformation
checked by the timid prudence of diplomatists; but
when diplomacy was put to flight at Berne, the torrent so
long restrained poured violently onwards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROMISH RELICS.</div>

<p>Vadianus, burgomaster of St. Gall, who presided at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Bernese disputation, had scarcely returned home, when the
citizens, with the authority of the magistrates, removed the
images from the church of St. Magnus, carried to the mint
a hand of the patron saint in silver, with other articles of
plate, and distributed among the poor the money they received
in exchange; thus, like Mary, pouring their precious
ointment on the head of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a> The people of St. Gall,
being curious to unveil the ancient mysteries, laid their
hands on the abbey itself, on the shrines and crosses which
had so long been presented to their adoration; but instead
of saintly relics, they found, to their great surprise, nothing
but some resin, a few pieces of money, several paltry wooden
images, some old rags, a skull, a large tooth, and a snail's
shell! Rome, instead of that noble fall which marks the
ends of great characters, sunk in the midst of stupid superstitions,
shameful frauds, and the ironical laughter of a whole
nation.</p>

<p>Such discoveries unfortunately excited the passions of the
multitude. One evening some evil disposed persons, wishing
to alarm the poor nuns of St. Catherine, who had obstinately
resisted the Reform, surrounded the convent with loud cries.
In vain did the nuns barricade the doors; the walls were soon
scaled, and the good wine, meat, confectionaries, and all the
far from ascetic delicacies of the cloister became the prey of
these rude jesters. Another persecution awaited them:
Doctor Schappeler having been appointed their catechist, they
were recommended to lay aside their monastic dress, and to
attend his heretical sermons "clothed like all the world," said
the sister Wiborath. Some of them embraced the Reform,
but thirty others preferred exile.<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> On the 5th February
1528, a numerous synod framed the constitution of the church
of St. Gall.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">CONTESTS.</div>

<p>The struggle was more violent at Glaris. The seeds of
the Gospel truth, which Zwingle had scattered there, had
prospered but little. The men in power anxiously rejected
every innovation, and the people loved better "to leap and
dance, and work miracles, <i>glass in hand</i>," as an old chronicle
says, "than to busy themselves about the Gospel." The
Landsgemeinde having pronounced, on the 15th May 1528,
in favour of the Mass by a majority of thirty-three voices, the
two parties were marked out with greater distinctness: the
images were broken at Matt, at Elm, at Bettschwanden, and
as each man remained aloof in his own house and village,
there was no longer in the canton either council of state or
tribunal of justice. At Schwanden, the minister Peter
Rumelin, having invited the Roman-catholics to a disputation
with him in the church, the latter, instead of discussing,
marched in procession to the sound of drums round the place
of worship in which the Reformed were assembled, and then
rushing into the pastor's house, which was situated in the
middle of the city, destroyed the stoves and the windows:
the irritated Reformed took their revenge and broke the
images. On the 15th April 1529, an agreement was concluded,
by virtue of which every man was free to choose
between the Mass and the Sermon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPREAD OF REFORM.</div>

<p>At Wesen, where Schwytz exercised sovereignty conjointly
with Glaris, the deputies of the former canton threatened the
people. Upon this the young men took the images out of the
churches, carried them to an open place near the banks of
the picturesque lake of Wallenstadt, above which soar the
mountains of the Ammon and of the Seven Electors, and
cried: "Look! this road (that by the lake) leads to Coire
and to Rome; that (to the south) to Glaris; this other (to
the west) to Schwytz; and the fourth (by the Ammon) to St.
Gall. Take which you please! But if you do not move off,
you shall be burnt!" After waiting a few moments, these
young people flung the motionless images into the fire, and
the Schwytz deputies, eye-witnesses of this execution, withdrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
in consternation, and filled the whole canton with projects
of vengeance that were but too soon realized.</p>

<p>In the canton of Appenzell, where a conference had been
opened, there suddenly appeared a band of Roman-catholics,
armed with whips and clubs, and crying out: "Where are
these preachers? we are resolved to put them out of the
village!" These strange doctors wounded the ministers and
dispersed the assembly with their whips. Out of the eight
parishes of the canton, six embraced the Reform, and Appenzell
became finally divided into little sections, the one Romanist
and the other Reformed.</p>

<p>In the Grisons religious liberty was proclaimed; the
parishes had the election of their pastors, several castles
were rased to the ground to render all return to arbitrary
government impossible, and the affrighted bishop went and
hid in the Tyrol his anger and his desire for vengeance.
"The Grisons," said Zwingle, "advance daily. It is a
nation that by its courage reminds us of the ancient Tuscans,
and by its candour of the ancient Swiss."<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">OBSTACLES IN BASLE.</div>

<p>Schaffhausen, after having long "halted between two
opinions," at the summons of Zurich and of Berne removed
the images from its churches without tumult or disorder.
At the same time the Reformation invaded Thurgovia, the
valley of the Rhine, and other bailiwicks subordinate to these
cantons. In vain did the Roman-catholic cantons, that
were in the majority, protest against it. "When temporal
affairs are concerned," replied Zurich and Berne, "we
will not oppose a plurality of votes; but the Word of God
cannot be subjected to the suffrages of men." All the districts
that lie along the banks of the Thur, of the Lake of
Constance, and of the Upper Rhine, embraced the Gospel.
The inhabitants of Mammeren, near the place where the
Rhine issues from the lake, flung their images into the water.
But the statue of St. Blaise, after remaining some time upright,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
and contemplating the ungrateful spot whence it was
banished, swam across the lake to Catahorn, situated on the
opposite shore, if we may believe the account of a monk
named Lang.<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> Even while running away Popery worked
its miracles.</p>

<p>Thus were the popular superstitions overthrown in Switzerland,
and sometimes not without violence. Every great
development in human affairs brings with it an energetic
opposition to that which has existed. It necessarily contains
an aggressive element, which ought to act freely, and
by that means open the new path. In the times of the Reformation
the doctors attacked the Pope, and the people the
images. The movement almost always exceeded a just
moderation. In order that human nature may take one step
in advance, its pioneers must take many. Every superfluous
step should be condemned, and yet we must acknowledge
their necessity. Let us not forget this in the history of
the Reformation, and especially in that of Switzerland.</p>

<p>Zurich was reformed; Berne had just become so: Basle
still remained, before the great cities of the Confederation were
gained over to the Evangelical faith. The reformation of
this learned city was the most important consequence resulting
from that of the warlike Berne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZEAL OF THE CITIZENS.</div>

<p>For six years the Gospel had been preached in Basle.
The meek and pious &OElig;colampadius was always waiting for
happier times. "The darkness," said he, "is about to retire
before the rays of truth."<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> But his expectation was vain.
A triple aristocracy&mdash;the superior clergy, the nobles, and the
university&mdash;checked the free expansion of christian convictions.
It was the middle classes who were destined to effect
the triumph of the Reformation in Basle.<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> Unhappily the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
popular wave invades nothing without tossing up some foul
scum.</p>

<p>It is true that the Gospel had many friends in the councils:
but being men of a middle party, they tacked backwards
and forwards like Erasmus, instead of sailing straight
to the port. They ordered "the pure preaching of the
Word of God;" but stipulated at the same time that it should
be "without Lutheranism." The aged and pious bishop
Utenheim, who was living in retirement at Bruntrut, tottered
daily into the church, supported by two domestics, to celebrate
Mass with a broken voice. Gundelsheim, an enemy
of the Reformation, succeeded him erelong; and on the 23d
September, followed by many exiles and with a train of forty
horses, he made his triumphal entry into Basle, proposing to
restore everything to its ancient footing. This made &OElig;colampadius
write in alarm to Zwingle: "Our cause hangs
upon a thread."</p>

<p>But in the citizens the Reform found a compensation for
the disdain of the great, and for the terrors inspired by the
new bishop. They organized repasts for fifty and a hundred
guests each; &OElig;colampadius and his colleagues took
their seats at these tables with the people, where energetic
acclamations and reiterated cheers greeted the work of the
Reformation. In a short time even the council appeared to
incline to the side of the Gospel. Twenty feast-days were
retrenched, and the priests were permitted to refuse celebrating
the Mass. "It is all over with Rome," was now
the cry. But &OElig;colampadius, shaking his head, replied; "I
am afraid that, by wishing to sit on the two stools, Basle
will at last fall to the ground."<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">WITTICISM OF ERASMUS.</div>

<p>This was at the period of his return from his discussion
at Berne. He arrived in time to close the eyes of his pious
mother; and then the reformer found himself alone, succumbing
under the weight of public and domestic cares; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
his house was like an inn for all fugitive Christians. "I
shall marry a Monica,"<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> he had often said, "or else I shall
remain a bachelor." He thought he had now discovered the
"christian sister" he was in search of. This was Wilibrandis,
daughter of one of the Emperor Maximilian's knights,
and widow of a master of arts named Keller,&mdash;a woman
already proved by many trials. He married her, saying:
"I look to the ordinances of God, and not to the scowling
faces of men." This did not prevent the sly Erasmus from
exclaiming: "Luther's affair is called a tragedy, but I maintain
it is a comedy, for each act of the drama ends in a
wedding." This witticism has been often repeated. For
a long time it was the fashion to account for the Reformation
by the desire of the princes for the church-property,
and of the priests for marriage. This vulgar method is
now stigmatized by the best Roman controversialists as "a
proof of a singularly narrow mind.&mdash;The Reformation originated,"
add they, "in a true and christian, although unenlightened
zeal."<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a></p>

<p>The return of &OElig;colampadius had still more important consequences
for Basle than it had for himself. The discussion
at Berne caused a great sensation there. "Berne, the powerful
Berne, is reforming!" was passed from mouth to mouth.
"How, then!" said the people one to another, "the fierce
bear has come out of his den......he is groping about
for the rays of the sun......and Basle, the city of learning&mdash;Basle,
the adopted city of Erasmus and of &OElig;colampadius,
remaining in darkness!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">HALF-MEASURES.</div>

<p>On Good Friday (10th April, 1528), without the knowledge
of the council and &OElig;colampadius, five workmen of the
Spinners' Company entered the church of St. Martin, which
was that of the reformer, and where the Mass was already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
abolished, and carried away all the "idols." On Easter
Monday, after the evening sermon, thirty-four citizens removed
all the images from the church of the Augustines.</p>

<p>This was going too far. Were they desirous, then, of
drawing Basle and its councils from that just medium in
which they had till this moment so wisely halted? The
council met hastily on Tuesday morning, and sent the five
men to prison; but, on the intercession of the burghers, they
were released, and the images suppressed in five other
churches. These half-measures sufficed for a time.</p>

<p>On a sudden the flame burst out anew with greater violence.
Sermons were preached at St. Martin's and St.
Leonard's against the abominations of the cathedral; and
at the cathedral the Reformers were called "heretics, knaves,
and profligates."<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> The Papists celebrated mass upon mass.
The burgomaster Meyer, a friend of the Reform, had with
him the majority of the people; the burgomaster Meltinger,
an intrepid leader of the partisans of Rome, prevailed in
the councils: a collision became inevitable. "The fatal
hour approaches," says &OElig;colampadius, "terrible for the
enemies of God."<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">COMMOTION IN BASLE.</div>

<p>On Wednesday the 23d December, two days before Christmas,
three hundred citizens from all the companies, pious
and worthy men, assembled in the hall of the Gardeners'
Company, and there drew up a petition to the senate. During
this time the friends of Popery, who resided for the most
part in Little Basle and the suburb of St. Paul, took up
arms, brandishing their swords and lances against the Reformed
citizens at the very moment that these were bearing
their petition to the council, and endeavoured, although ineffectually,
to bar their road. Meltinger haughtily refused to
receive the petition, and charged the burghers, on the faith
of their civic oath, to return to their homes. The burgomaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
Meyer, however, took the address, and the senate ordered
it to be read.</p>

<p>"Honoured, wise, and gracious Lords," it ran, "we, your
dutiful fellow-citizens of the companies, address you as well-beloved
fathers, whom we are ready to obey at the cost of
our goods and of our lives. Take God's glory to heart;
restore peace to the city; and oblige all the Pope's preachers
to discuss freely with the ministers. If the Mass be true, we
desire to have it in our churches; but if it is an abomination
before God, why, through love for the priests, should we
draw down His terrible anger upon ourselves and upon our
children?"</p>

<p>Thus spoke the citizens of Basle. There was nothing
revolutionary either in their language or in their proceedings.
They desired what was right with decision, but also with
calmness. All might still proceed with order and decorum.
But here begins a new period: the vessel of Reform is about
to enter the port, but not until it has passed through violent
storms.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>V. It was the bishop's partisans who first departed from
the legal course. Filled with terror on learning that mediators
were expected from Zurich and Berne, they ran into
the city, crying that an Austrian army was coming to their
aid, and collected stones in their houses. The Reformed did
the same. The disturbance increased hourly, and in the
night of the 25th December the Papists met under arms:
priests with arquebuse in hand were numbered among their
ranks.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the Reformed learnt this, when some of them
running hastily from house to house, knocked at the doors and
awoke their friends, who, starting out of bed, seized their
muskets and repaired to the Gardeners' Hall, the rendezvous
of their party. They soon amounted to three thousand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HALF-MEASURES REJECTED.</div>

<p>Both parties passed the night under arms. At every moment
a civil war, and what is worse, "a war of hearths,"
might break out. It was at last agreed that each party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
should nominate delegates to treat with the senate on this
matter. The Reformed chose thirty men of respectability,
courage, faith, and experience, who took up their quarters at
the Gardeners' Hall. The partisans of the ancient faith
chose also a commission, but less numerous and less respectable:
their station was at the Fishmongers' Hall. The council
was constantly sitting. All the gates of the city, except
two, were closed; strong guards were posted in every quarter.
Deputies from Lucerne, Uri, Schaffhausen, Zug,
Schwytz, Mulhausen, and Strasburg, arrived successively.
The agitation and tumult increased from hour to hour.</p>

<p>It was necessary to put an end to so violent a crisis.
The senate, faithful to its ideas of half-measures, decreed
that the priest should continue to celebrate the Mass; but
that all, priests and ministers, should preach the Word of
God, and for this purpose should meet once a-week to confer
upon the holy Scriptures. They then called the Lutherans
together in the Franciscan church, and the Papists in that
belonging to the Dominicans. The senate first repaired to
the former church, where they found two thousand five hundred
citizens assembled. The secretary had hardly read the
ordinance before a great agitation arose. "That shall not
be," cried one of the people.<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> "We will not put up with
the Mass, not even with a single one!" cried another; and
all repeated, "No Mass,&mdash;no Mass,&mdash;we will die sooner!"<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a></p>

<p>The senate having next visited the Dominican church, all
the Romanists, to the number of six hundred, among whom
were many foreign servants, cried out: "We are ready to
sacrifice our lives for the Mass. We swear it, we swear
it!" repeated they with uplifted hands. "If they reject the
Mass&mdash;to arms! to arms!"<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a></p>

<p>The senate withdrew more embarrassed than ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REFORMED PROPOSITIONS.</div>

<p>The two parties were again assembled three days after.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
&OElig;colampadius was in the pulpit. "Be meek and tractable,"
said he; and he preached with such unction that many were
ready to burst into tears.<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> The assembly offered up prayers,
and then decreed that it would accept a new ordinance, by
virtue of which, fifteen days after Pentecost, there should be
a public disputation, in which no arguments should be employed
but such as were drawn from the Word of God: after
this a general vote should take place upon the Mass, that the
majority should decide the question, and that in the meanwhile
the Mass should be celebrated in three churches only;
it being however understood, that nothing should be taught
there that was in opposition to the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<p>The Romanist minority rejected these propositions:
"Basle," said they, "is not like Berne and Zurich. Its
revenues are derived in great measure from countries opposed
to the Reformation!" The priests having refused to resort
to the weekly conferences, they were suspended; and during
a fortnight there was neither sermon nor mass at the cathedral,
or in the churches of St. Ulric, St. Peter, and St. Theodore.</p>

<p>Those who remained faithful to Rome resolved upon an
intrepid defence. Meltinger placed Sebastian Muller in the
pulpit at St. Peter's, from which he had been interdicted, and
this hot-headed priest vented such abusive sarcasms against
the Reform, that several of the Evangelicals, who were listening
to the sermon, were insulted and nearly torn in pieces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A NIGHT OF TERROR.</div>

<p>It was necessary to arouse Basle from this nightmare, and
strike a decisive blow. "Let us remember our liberty,"
said the reformed citizens, "and what we owe to the glory of
Christ, to public justice, and to our posterity."<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> They then
demanded that the enemies of the Reformation, friends and
relations of the priests, who were the cause of all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
delays and of all these troubles, should no longer sit in the
councils until peace was re-established. This was the 8th
February. The council notified that they would return an
answer on the morrow.</p>

<p>At six o'clock in the evening, twelve hundred citizens
were assembled in the corn-market. They began to fear
that the delay required by the senate concealed some evil
design. "We must have a reply this very night," they said.
The senate was convoked in great haste.</p>

<p>From that period affairs assumed a more threatening attitude
in Basle. Strong guards were posted by the burghers
in the halls of the different guilds; armed men patrolled the
city, and bivouacked in the public places, to anticipate the
machinations of their adversaries;<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> the chains were stretched
across the streets; torches were lighted, and resinous trees,
whose flickering light scattered the darkness, were placed at
intervals through the town; six pieces of artillery were
planted before the town hall; and the gates of the city, as
well as the arsenal and the ramparts, were occupied. Basle
was in a state of siege.</p>

<p>There was no longer any hope for the Romish party. The
burgomaster, Meltinger, an intrepid soldier and one of the
heroes of Marignan, where he had led eight hundred men
into battle, lost courage. In the darkness he gained the banks
of the Rhine with his son-in-law, the councillor Eglof d'Offenburg,
embarked unnoticed in a small boat, and rapidly
descended the stream amid the fogs of the night.<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> Other
members of the council escaped in a similar manner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE IDOLS BROKEN.</div>

<p>This gave rise to new alarms. "Let us beware of their
secret man&oelig;uvres," said the people. "Perhaps they are
going to fetch the Austrians, with whom they have so often
threatened us!" The affrighted citizens collected arms from
every quarter, and at break of day they had two thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
men on foot. The beams of the rising sun fell on this resolute
but calm assembly.</p>

<p>It was midday. The senate had come to no decision: the
impatience of the burghers could be restrained no longer.
Forty men were detached to visit the posts. As this patrol
was passing the cathedral, they entered it, and one of the citizens,
urged by curiosity, opened a closet with his halberd, in
which some images had been hidden. One of them fell out,
and was broken into a thousand pieces against the stone pavement.<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a>
The sight of these fragments powerfully moved the
spectators, who began throwing down one after another all
the images that were concealed in this place. None of them
offered any resistance: heads, feet, and hands&mdash;all were
heaped in confusion before the halberdiers. "I am much
surprised," said Erasmus, "that they preformed no miracle
to save themselves; formerly the saints worked frequent prodigies
for much smaller offences!"<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> Some priests ran to the
spot, and the patrol withdrew.</p>

<p>A rumour, however, having spread that a disturbance had
taken place in this church, three hundred men came to the
support of the forty. "Why," said they, "should we spare
the idols that light up the flames of discord?" The priests
in alarm had closed the gates of the sanctuary, drawn the
bolts, raised barricades, and prepared everything for maintaining
a siege. But the townspeople, whose patience had
been exhausted by the delays of the council, dash against one
of the doors of the church: it yields to their blows, and they
rush into the cathedral. The hour of madness has arrived.
These men are no longer to be recognized, as they brandish
their swords, rattle their pikes, and utter formidable cries:
are they Goths, or are they fervent worshippers of God,
animated by the zeal which in times of yore inflamed the
prophets and the kings of Israel? However that might be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
these proceedings were disorderly, since public authority
alone can interfere in public reforms. Images, altars, pictures&mdash;all
were thrown down and destroyed. The priests
who had fled into the vestry, and there concealed themselves,
trembled in every limb at the terrible noise made by the
fall of their holy decorations. The work of destruction was
completed without one of them venturing to save the objects
of his worship, or to make the slightest remonstrance. The
people next piled up the fragments in the squares and set
fire to them; and during the chilly night the armed burghers
stood round and warmed themselves at the crackling flame.<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a></p>

<p>The senate collected in amazement, and desired to interpose
their authority and appease the tumult; but they might
as well have striven to command the winds. The enthusiastic
citizens replied to their magistrates in these haughty
words: "What you have not been able to effect in three
years, we will complete in one hour."<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a></p>

<p>In truth the anger of the people was no longer confined to
the cathedral. They respected all kinds of private property;<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a>
but they attacked the churches of St. Peter, St. Ulric,
St. Alban, and of the Dominicans; and in all these temples
"the idols" fell under the blows of these good citizens of
Basle, whom an extraordinary zeal inflamed. Already they
were making preparations to cross the bridge and enter Little
Basle, which was devoted to the cause of Popery, when the
alarmed inhabitants begged to be allowed to remove the
images themselves, and with heavy hearts they hastily carried
them into the upper chambers of the church, whence they
hoped to be able after a time to restore them to their old position.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE REFORM LEGALIZED.</div>

<p>They did not stop at these energetic demonstrations; the
most excited talked of going to the town-hall, and of constraining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
the senate to accede to the wishes of the people; but the
good sense of the majority treated these brawlers as they
deserved, and checked their guilty thoughts.</p>

<p>The senators now perceived the necessity of giving a legal
character to this popular movement, and of thus changing a
tumultuous revolution into a durable reformation.<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a> Democracy
and the Gospel were thus established simultaneously
in Basle. The senate, after an hour's deliberation, granted
that in future the burghers should participate in the election
of the two councils; that from this day the Mass and images
should be abolished throughout all the canton, and that in
every deliberation which concerned the glory of God or the
good of the state the opinion of the guilds should be taken.
The people, delighted at having obtained these conditions,
which secured their political and religious liberty, returned
joyful to their houses. It was now the close of day.<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">OBJECTIONS.</div>

<p>On the morrow, Ash-Wednesday, it was intended to distribute
the ruins of the altars and other ornaments of the
Church among the poor, to serve them for firewood. But
these unhappy creatures, in their eagerness for the fragments,
having begun to dispute about them, they constructed great
piles in the cathedral close and set fire to them. "The
idols," said some wags, "are really keeping their Ash-Wednesday
to-day!" The friends of Popery, turning away their
horror-stricken eyes from this sacrilegious sight, says &OElig;colampadius,
shed tears of blood. "Thus severely did they
treat the idols," continues the reformer, "and the Mass died
of grief in consequence."<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> On the following Sunday hymns
in German were sung at every church; and on the 18th
February a general amnesty was published. Everything
was changed in Basle. The last had become first, and the
first last. While &OElig;colampadius, who a few years before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
had entered the city as a stranger, without resources and
without power, found himself raised to the first station in the
Church, Erasmus, disturbed in the quiet study whence during
so long a period he had issued his absolute commands to
the world of letters, saw himself compelled to descend into
the arena. But this king of the schools had no desire to lay
down his sceptre before the sovereign people. For a long
time he used to turn aside his head when he met his friend
&OElig;colampadius. Besides he feared by remaining at Basle to
compromise himself with his protectors. "The torrent," said
he, "which was hidden underground has burst forth with
violence, and committed frightful ravages.<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> My life is in
danger: &OElig;colampadius possesses all the churches. People
are continually bawling in my ears; I am besieged with
letters, caricatures, and pamphlets. It is all over: I am
resolved to leave Basle. Only shall I or shall I not depart by
stealth? The one is more becoming, the other more secure."</p>

<p>Wishing as much as possible to make his honour and his
prudence agree, Erasmus desired the boatman with whom he
was to descend the Rhine to depart from an unfrequented
spot. This was opposed by the senate, and the timid philosopher
was compelled to enter the boat as it lay near the great
bridge, at that time covered with a crowd of people. He
floated down the river, sadly bade adieu to the city he had
so much loved, and retired to Friburg in Brisgau with several
other learned men.</p>

<p>New professors were invited to fill the vacant chairs in the
university, and in particular Oswald Myconius, Phrygio,
Sebastian Munster, and Simon Grynæus. At the same time
was published an ecclesiastical order and a confession of
faith, one of the most precious documents of this epoch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRINCIPLES OF THE REFORMATION.</div>

<p>Thus had a great transformation been effected without the
loss of a single drop of blood. Popery had fallen in Basle in
despite of the secular and spiritual power. "The wedge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the Lord," says &OElig;colampadius, "has split this hard
knot."<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a></p>

<p>We cannot, however, help acknowledging that the Basle
Reformation may afford ground for some objections. Luther
had opposed himself to the power of the many. "When the
people prick up their ears, do not whistle too loud. It is
better to suffer at the hand of one tyrant, that is to say, of a
king, than of a thousand tyrants, that is to say, of the people."
On this account the German Reformer has been reproached
for acknowledging no other policy than servilism.</p>

<p>Perhaps when the Swiss Reformation is canvassed, a contrary
objection will be made against it, and the Reform at
Basle, in particular, will be looked upon as a revolution.</p>

<p>The Reformation must of necessity bear the stamp of the
country in which it was accomplished: it will be monarchical
in Germany, republican in Switzerland. Nevertheless,
in religion as in politics, there is a great difference between
reformation and revolution.</p>

<p>In neither of these spheres does Christianity desire either
despotism, servitude, stagnation, retrogression, or death. But
while looking for progress, it seeks to accomplish it by reformation
and not by revolution.</p>

<p>Reformation works by the power of the Word, of doctrine,
cultivation and truth; while revolution, or rather revolt, operates
by the power of riot, of the sword, and of the club.</p>

<p>Christianity proceeds by the inner man, and charters themselves,
if they stand alone, cannot satisfy it. No doubt constitutions
are one of the blessings of our age; but it is not
sufficient for these securities to be committed to parchment;
they must be written in the heart, and guaranteed by the manners
of the people.</p>

<p>Such were the principles of the Swiss Reformers, such
were those of the Reform at Basle, and by these it is distinguished
from a revolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREL'S COMMISSION.</div>

<p>There were, it is true, some excesses. Never perhaps has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
a reformation been accomplished among men without some
mixture of revolution. But it was doctrines, however, that
were in question at Basle: these doctrines had acted powerfully
on the moral convictions and on the lives of the people;
the movement had taken place within before it showed itself
without. But more than this: the Reformation was not satisfied
with taking away; it gave more than it took; and, far
from confining itself to the work of destruction, it scattered
rich blessings over all the people.<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a></p>

<p>VI. The recoil of the discussion at Berne had overthrown
Popery in a considerable part of German Switzerland. It
was also felt in many of the churches of French Switzerland,
lying at the foot of the Jura, or scattered amid the pine forests
of its elevated valleys, and which up to this time had shown
the most absolute devotion to the Roman pontiff.</p>

<p>Farel, seeing the Gospel established in the places where the
Rhone mingles its sandy waters with the crystal Leman,
turned his eyes to another quarter. He was supported by
Berne. This state, which possessed jointly with Friburg the
bailiwicks of Morat, Orbe, and Granson, and which had alliances
with Lausanne, Avenches, Payerne, Neuchatel, and
Geneva, saw that both its interest and its duty alike called
it to have the Gospel preached to its allies and subjects. Farel
was empowered to carry it among them, always with
reserve of the consent of the respective governments.</p>

<p>One day, therefore, journeying towards Morat, Farel arrived
and preached the Gospel at the foot of those towers and battlements
that had been attacked at three different periods by
the armies of Conrad the Salic, Rodolph of Hapsburg, and
Charles the Bold. Erelong the friends of the Reform amounted
to a great number. A general vote having nevertheless
declared in favour of the Pope, Farel proceeded to Lausanne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREL AT MORAT.</div>

<p>He was at first driven away by the bishop and the clergy,
but soon reappeared provided with a letter from the lords of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Berne. "We send him to you," said their excellencies to the
authorities of the city, "to defend his own cause and ours.
Allow him to preach the Word of God, and beware that you
touch not a hair of his head."</p>

<p>There was great confusion in the councils. Placed between
Berne and the bishop, what could they do? The
Council of Twenty four, finding the matter very serious, convoked
the Council of Sixty; and this body, excusing itself,
they convoked the Council of Two Hundred, on the 14th November
1529. But these in their turn referred the business
to the smaller council. No one would have anything to do
with it. The inhabitants of Lausanne, it is true, complained
loudly of the holy members of their chapters, whose lives
(they said) were one long orgy; but when their eyes turned
on the austere countenance of Reform, they were still more
terrified. Besides, how deprive Lausanne of her bishop, her
court, and her dignitaries? What! no more pilgrims in the
churches,&mdash;no more suitors in the ecclesiastical courts,&mdash;no
more purchasers in the markets, or boon companions in the
taverns! The widowed and desolate Lausanne would no
longer behold the noisy throng of people, that were at once her
wealth and her glory!&mdash;Better far a disorder that enriches,
than a Reform that impoverishes! Farel was compelled to
depart a second time.</p>

<p>He returned to Morat, and soon the Word gained over
the hearts of the people. On feast-days, the roads from
Payerne and Avenches were covered with merry bands,
who laughingly said to one another, "Let us go to Morat and
hear the preachers!" and exhorted each other slily, as they
went along the road, "not to fall into the nets of the heretics."
But at night, all was changed. Grasped by the strong hand
of truth, these very people returned,&mdash;some in deep thought,
others discussing with animation the doctrines they had heard.
The fire was sparkling throughout all this district, and spreading
in every direction its long rays of light. This was enough
for Farel: he required new conquests.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NEUCHATEL.</div>

<p>At a short distance from Morat lay one of the strongholds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
of Popery&mdash;the Earldom of Neuchatel. Joan of Hochberg,
who had inherited this principality from her ancestors, had
married, in 1504, Louis of Orleans, Duke of Longueville.
This French nobleman having supported the King of France
in 1512, in a war against the Swiss, the cantons had taken
possession of Neuchatel, but had restored it to his widow in
1529.</p>

<p>Few countries could have presented greater difficulties
to the daring reformer. The princess of Longueville, residing
in France in the suite of Francis I., a woman of courtly
habits, vain, extravagant, always in debt, and thinking of
Neuchatel only as a farm that should bring her in a large
revenue, was devoted to the Pope and Popery. Twelve
canons with several priests and chaplains formed a powerful
clergy, at whose head was the provost Oliver of Hochberg,
natural brother to the princess. Auxiliaries full of zeal flanked
this main army. On the one side there was the abbey of
the Premonstrantes of Fontaine-André, three quarters of a
league beyond the town, the monks of which, after having
in the twelfth century cleared the ground with their own
hands,<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> had gradually become powerful lords; and, on the
other side, the Benedictines of the Island of St. John, whose
abbot, having been deposed by the Bernese, had taken refuge,
burning with hatred and vengeance, in his priory at Corcelles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREL'S LABOURS.</div>

<p>The people of Neuchatel had a great respect for ancient
rights, and it was easy to take advantage of this state of
feeling, considering the general ignorance, to maintain the
innovations of Popery. The canons improved the opportunity.
For the instructions of the Gospel they substituted
pomps and shows. The church, situated on a steep rock,
was filled with altars, chapels, and images of saints; and religion,
descending from this sanctuary, ran up and down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
streets, and was travestied in dramas and mysteries, mingled
with indulgences, miracles, and debauchery.<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a></p>

<p>The soldiers of Neuchatel, however, who had made the
campaign of 1529 with the Bernese army, brought back to
their homes the liveliest enthusiasm for the Evangelical cause.
It was at this period that a frail boat, quitting the southern
bank of the lake, on the side opposite Morat, and carrying
a Frenchman of mean appearance, steered towards the Neuchatel
shore. Farel, for it was he, had learnt that the village
of Serrière, situated at the gates of Neuchatel, depended in
spiritualities on the evangelical city of Bienne, and that Emer
Beynon, the priest of the place, "had some liking for the
Gospel." The plan of his campaign was immediately drawn
up. He appeared before parson Emer, who received him
with joy; but what could be done? for Farel had been interdicted
from preaching in any church whatever in the earldom.
The poor priest thought to reconcile everything by
permitting Farel to mount on a stone in the cemetery, and
thus preach to the people, turning his back upon the church.<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a></p>

<p>A great disturbance arose in Neuchatel. On one side the
government, the canons, and the priests, cried "Heresy!"
but, on the other, "some inhabitants of Neuchatel, to whom
God had given a knowledge of the truth,"<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> flocked to Serrière.
In a short time these last could not contain themselves:
"Come," said they to Farel, "and preach to us in
the town."</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREL'S PREACHING.</div>

<p>This was at the beginning of December. They entered
by the gate of the castle, and leaving the church on the hill
to the left, they passed in front of the canons' houses, and
descended through the narrow streets inhabited by the citizens.
On reaching the market-cross, Farel ascended a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
platform and addressed the crowd, which gathered together
from all the neighbourhood,&mdash;weavers, vine-dressers, husbandmen,
a worthy race, possessing more feeling than imagination.
The preacher's exterior was grave, his discourse
energetic, his voice like thunder: his eyes, his features, his
gestures, all showed him a man of intrepidity. The citizens,
accustomed to run about the streets after the mountebanks,
were touched by his powerful language. "Farel preached
a sermon of such great efficacy," says a manuscript, "that
he gained over much people."<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a></p>

<p>Some monks, however, with shaven crowns,<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> glided among
his hearers, seeking to excite them against the heretical minister.
"Let us beat out his brains," said some. "Duck him,
duck him!" cried others, advancing to throw Farel into a
fountain, which may still be seen near the spot where he
preached. But the reformer stood firm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POPERY IN NEUCHATEL.</div>

<p>This first preaching was succeeded by others. To this
Gospel missionary every place was a church; every stone,
every bench, every platform was a pulpit. Already the cutting
winds and the snows of December should have kept the
Neuchatelans around their firesides; "the canons made a
vigorous defence;"<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> and in every quarter "the shorn
crowns" were in agitation, supplicating, menacing, howling,
and threatening,&mdash;but all was useless. No sooner did this
man of small stature rise up in any place, with his pale yet
sunburnt complexion, with red and unkempt beard, with
sparkling eye and expressive mouth, than the monks' labour
was lost: the people collected around, for it was the Word of
God that fell from his lips.<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> All eyes were fixed on him:
with open mouth and attentive ears they hung upon his
words.<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> And scarcely does he begin to speak, when&mdash;Oh!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
wonderful work of God! he himself exclaims&mdash;this multitude
believes as if it had but one soul.</p>

<p>The Word of God carried the town, as it were, at the first
assault; and throwing down the devices Rome had taken ages
to compose, established itself in triumph on the ruins of
human traditions. Farel saw in imagination Jesus Christ
himself walking in spirit through the midst of this crowd,
opening the eyes of the blind, softening the hard heart, and
working miracles,<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a>......so that scarcely had he returned to
his humble residence before he wrote to his friends with a
heart full of emotion: "Render thanks with me to the Father
of mercies, in that he has shown his favour to those bowed
down by a weighty tyranny;" and falling on his knees, he
worshipped God.<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a></p>

<p>But during this time what were the adherents of the Pope
doing in Neuchatel?</p>

<p>The canons, members of the General Audiences, of which
they formed the first estate, treated both priests and laymen
with intolerable haughtiness. Laying the burden of their
offices on poor curates, they publicly kept dissolute women,
clothed them sumptuously, endowed their children by public
acts, fought in the church, haunted the streets by night, or
went into a foreign country to enjoy in secret the produce of
their avarice and of their intrigues. Some poor lepers placed
in a house near the city were maintained by the produce of
certain offerings. The rich canons, in the midst of their
banquets, dared take away the bread of charity from these
unhappy wretches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RESISTANCE OF THE MONKS.</div>

<p>The abbey of Fontaine-André was at a little distance from
the town. Now the canons of Neuchatel and the monks of
Fontaine were at open war. These hostile powers, encamped
on their two hills, disputed each other's property,
wrested away each other's privileges, launched at one another
the coarsest insults, and even came to blows. "Debaucher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
of women!" said the canons to the abbot of Fontaine-André,
who returned the compliment in the same coin. It is the
Reformation which, through faith, has re-established the moral
law in Christendom,&mdash;a law that Popery had trodden under
foot.</p>

<p>For a long time these conventual wars had disturbed the
country. On a sudden they cease. A strange event is
passing in Neuchatel,&mdash;the Word of God is preached there.
The canons, seized with affright in the midst of their disorders,
look down from their lofty dwellings on this new movement.
The report reaches Fontaine-André. The monks and
priests suspend their orgies and their quarrels. The heathen
sensualism that had invaded the Church is put to the rout;
Christian spiritualism has reappeared.</p>

<p>Immediately the monks and canons, so long at war, embrace
and unite against the Reformer. "We must save religion,"
said they, meaning their tithes, banquets, scandals,
and privileges. Not one of them could oppose a doctrine to
the doctrine preached by Farel: to insult him was their sole
weapon. At Corcelles, however, they went farther. As the
minister was proclaiming the Gospel near the priory, the
monks fell upon him; in the midst of them was the prior
Rodolph de Benoit, storming, exciting, and striving to augment
the tempest. He even had a dagger in his hand, according
to one writer.<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a> Farel escaped with difficulty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREL'S LABOURS.</div>

<p>This was not enough. Popery, as it always does, had
recourse to the civil power. The canons, the abbot, and the
prior, solicited the governor George de Rive at the same time.
Farel stood firm. "The glory of Jesus Christ," said he,
"and the lively affection his sheep bear to his Word, constrain
me to endure sufferings greater than tongue can describe."<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a>
Erelong, however, he was compelled to yield.
Farel again crossed the lake; but this passage was very different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
from the former. The fire was kindled!&mdash;On the 22d
December he was at Morat; and shortly after at Aigle.</p>

<p>He was recalled hence. On the 7th January, religion was
put to the vote at Morat, and the majority was in favour of
the Gospel. But the Romish minority, supported by Friburg,
immediately undertook to recover its ancient position by
insults and bad treatment. "Farel! Farel!" cried the
reformed party.<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a></p>

<p>A few days after this, Farel, accompanied by a Bernese
messenger, scaled that magnificent amphitheatre of mountains
above Vevay, whence the eye plunges into the waters
of the Leman; and soon he crossed the estates of Count John
of Gruyère, who was in the habit of saying, "We must burn
this French Luther!"<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> Scarcely had Farel reached the
heights of St. Martin de Vaud,<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> when he saw the vicar of the
place with two priests running to meet him. "Heretic!
devil!" cried they. But the knight, through fear of Berne,
remained behind his walls, and Farel passed on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREL IN NEUCHATEL.</div>

<p>The Reformer, not allowing himself to be stopped by the
necessity of defending himself in Morat, or by the inclemency
of the season, immediately carried the Gospel to those beautiful
hills that soar between the smiling waters of lakes Morat
and Neuchatel into the villages of the Vully. This man&oelig;uvre
was crowned with the most complete success. On
the 15th February four deputies from the Vully came to
Morat to demand permission to embrace the Reform, which
was immediately granted to them. "Let our ministers preach
the Gospel," said their excellencies of Berne to the Friburgers,
"and we will let your priests play their monkey tricks.
We desire to force no man."<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> The Reform restored freedom
of will to the Christian people. It was about this time that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
Farel wrote his beautiful letter "To all lords, people, and
pastors," which we have so often quoted.<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a></p>

<p>The indefatigable reformer now went forward to new conquests.
A chain of rocks separates the Juran valley of
Erguel, already evangelized by Farel, from the country of the
ancient Rauraci, and a passage cut through the rock serves
as a communication between the two districts. It was the
end of April when Farel, passing through the <i>Pierre-Pertuis</i>,<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a>
descended to the village of Tavannes, and entered the church
just as the priest was saying Mass. Farel went into the
pulpit: the astonished priest stopped,&mdash;the minister filled his
hearers with emotion, and seemed to them an angel come
down from heaven. Immediately the images and the altars
fell, and "the poor priest who was chanting the Mass could
not finish it."<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> To put down Popery had required less time
than the priest had spent at the altar.</p>

<p>A great part of the bishopric of Basle was in a few weeks
gained over to the Reformation.</p>

<p>During this time the Gospel was fermenting in Neuchatel.
The young men who had marched with Berne to deliver
Geneva from the attacks of Savoy, recounted in their jovial
meetings the exploits of the campaign, and related how the
soldiers of Berne, feeling cold, had taken the images from the
Dominican church at Geneva, saying: "Idols of wood are
of no use but to make a fire with in winter."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HOSPITAL CHAPEL.</div>

<p>Farel re-appeared in Neuchatel.<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> Being master of the
lower part of the town, he raised his eyes to the lofty rocks
on which soared the cathedral and the castle. The best plan,
thought he, is to bring these proud priests down to us. One
morning his young friends spread themselves in the streets,
and posted up large placards bearing these words: "<i>All</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
<i>those who say Mass are robbers, murderers, and seducers of the
people</i>."<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> Great was the uproar in Neuchatel. The canons
summoned their people, called together their clerks, and
marching at the head of a large troop, armed with swords and
clubs, descended into the town, tore down the sacrilegious
placards, and cited Farel before the tribunal as a slanderer,
demanding ten thousand crowns damages.</p>

<p>The two parties appeared in court, and this was all that
Farel desired. "I confess the fact," said he, "but I am
justified in what I have done. Where are there to be found
more horrible murderers, than these seducers who sell paradise,
and thus nullify the merits of our Lord Jesus Christ?
I will prove my assertion by the Gospel." And he prepared
to open it, when the canons, flushed with anger, cried out:
"The common law of Neuchatel, and not the Gospel, is in
question here! Where are the witnesses?" But Farel,
always returning to that fearful assertion, proved by the
Word of God that the canons were really guilty of murder and
robbery. To plead such a cause was to ruin Popery. The
court of Neuchatel, that had never heard a similar case,
resolved according to ancient custom to lay it before the
Council of Besançon,<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> which not daring to pronounce the first
estate of the General Audiences guilty of murder and robbery,
referred the matter to the Emperor and to a general council.
Bad causes gain nothing by making a disturbance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CIVIL POWER INVOKED.</div>

<p>At every step they wished to drive him back, Farel made
one in advance. The streets and the houses were still his
temple. One day when the people of Neuchatel were around
him, "Why," cried they, "should not the Word of God be
proclaimed in a church?" They then hurried Farel along
with them, opened the doors of the Hospital Chapel, set the
minister in the pulpit, and a numerous crowd stood silent
before him. "In like manner as Jesus Christ, appearing in a
state of poverty and humility, was born in a stable at Bethlehem,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
said the Reformer; "so this hospital, this abode of
the sick and of the poor, is to-day become his birthplace in the
town of Neuchatel." Then feeling ill at ease in the presence
of the painted and carved figures that decorated the chapel,
he laid his hands on these objects of idolatry, removed them,
and broke them in pieces.<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a></p>

<p>Popery, which anger had blinded, now took a step that it
undoubtedly had a right to take, but which destroyed it: it
had recourse to the secular arm, and the governor sent a
deputation to the Bernese council, praying the removal of
Farel and his companions.</p>

<p>But almost at the same time deputies from the townspeople
arrived at Berne. "Did not these hands bear arms at Interlaken
and at Bremgarten to support your Reformation? and
will you abandon us in ours?"</p>

<p>Berne hesitated. A public calamity was at that time filling
the whole city with mourning. One of the most illustrious
citizens of the republic, the Banneret of Weingarten, attacked
by the plague, was expiring amid the tears of his sons and of
his fellow-citizens. Being informed of the arrival of the
Neuchatelans, he rallied his waning strength: "Go," said he,
"and beg the senate in my name to ask for a general assembly
of the people of Neuchatel for Sunday next."<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> This
message of the dying banneret decided the council.</p>

<p>The deputies from Berne arrived in Neuchatel on the 7th
August. Farel thought that during the debates he had time
to make a new conquest, and quitted the city. His zeal can
be compared only to St. Paul's. His body was small and
feeble, but his activity was wholly apostolic: danger and bad
treatment wasted him every day, but he had within him a
divine power that rendered him victorious.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<div class="sidenote">THE FEAST OF ASSUMPTION.</div>

<p>VII. At the distance of a league from Neuchatel, beyond
the mountain, extends the Val de Ruz, and near its entrance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
in a precipitous situation, where roars an impetuous torrent
surrounded by steep crags, stands the town of Valangin. An
old castle, built on a rock, raises its vast walls into the air,
overlooking the humble dwellings of the townspeople, and
extending its jurisdiction over five valleys of these lofty and
severe mountains at that time covered with forests of pine,
but now peopled by the most active industry.<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a></p>

<p>In this castle dwelt Guillemette de Vergy, dowager-countess
of Valangin, strongly attached to the Romish religion and
full of respect for the memory of her husband. A hundred
priests had chanted high mass at the count's burial; many
penitent young women had been married, and large alms distributed;
the curate of Locle had been sent to Jerusalem, and
Guillemette herself had made a pilgrimage for the repose for
the soul of her departed lord.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, the Countess of Gruyère and other
ladies would come and visit the widow of Vergy, who assembled
in the castle a number of young lords. The fife and
tambourine re-echoed under its vaulted roofs, chattering groups
collected in the immense embrasures of its Gothic windows,
and merry dances followed hard upon a long silence and
gloomy devotion.<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a> There was but one sentiment that never
left Guillemette&mdash;this was her hatred against the Reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MASS INTERRUPTED.</div>

<p>Guillemette and the priests had in fact reason to tremble.
The 15th August was a great Romish festival&mdash;Our Lady of
August, or the Assumption. All the faithful of the Val de
Ruz were preparing to keep it. This was the very day Farel
selected. Animated by the fire and courage of Elijah, he set
out for Valangin, and a young man, his fellow-countryman,
and, as it would appear, a distant relation, Anthony Boyve,
an ardent Christian and a man of decided character, went
along with him.<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> The two missionaries climbed the mountain,
plunged into the pine forest, and then descending again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
into the valley, they traversed Valangin, where the vicinity
of the castle did not give them much encouragement to pause,
and arrived at a village, probably Boudevilliers, proposing
to preach the Gospel there.<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a></p>

<p>Already on all sides the people were thronging to the
church; Farel and his companion entered also with a small
number of the inhabitants who had heard him at Neuchatel.
The reformer immediately ascended the pulpit, and the priest
prepared to celebrate the Mass. The combat begins. While
the voice of Farel is preaching Jesus Christ and his promises,
the voices of the priests and of the choir are chanting the
missal. The solemn moment approaches: the ineffable transubstantiation
is about to take place: the priest pronounces
the sacred words over the elements. At this instant the
people hesitate no longer; ancient habits, an irresistible influence,
draw them towards the altar; the preacher is deserted;
the kneeling crowd has recovered its old worship; Rome is
triumphant.......Suddenly a young man springs from the
crowd,&mdash;traverses the choir,&mdash;rushes to the altar,&mdash;snatches
the host from the hands of the priest, and cries, as he turns
towards the people: "This is not the God whom you should
worship. He is above,&mdash;in heaven,&mdash;in the majesty of the
Father, and not, as you believe, in the hands of a priest."<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a>
This man was Anthony Boyve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREL'S DANGER.</div>

<p>Such a daring act at first produced the desired effect. The
Mass was interrupted, the chantings ceased, and the crowd,
as if struck by a supernatural intervention, remained silent
and noiseless. Farel, who was still in the pulpit, immediately
took advantage of this calm, and proclaimed that Christ
"whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution
of all things."<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a> Then the priests and choristers with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
adherents rushed to the towers, ran up into the belfry, and
sounded the tocsin.</p>

<p>These means succeeded: a crowd was collected, and if
Farel had not retired, his death and Boyve's would have been
inevitable. "But God," says the chronicle, "delivered them."
They crossed the interval that separates Boudevilliers from
Valangin, and drew near the steep gorges of the torrent of the
Seyon. But how traverse that town, which the tocsin had
already alarmed?</p>

<p>Leaving Chaumont and its dark forests to the left, these two
heralds of the Gospel took a narrow path that wound beneath
the castle: they were stealing cautiously along, when suddenly
a shower of stones assailed them, and at the same time
a score of individuals,&mdash;priests, men, and women,&mdash;armed
with clubs, fell furiously upon them. "The priests had not
the gout either in their feet or arms," says a chronicler;
"the ministers were so beaten that they nearly lost their
lives."<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a></p>

<p>Madame de Vergy, who descended to the terrace, far from
moderating the anger of the priests, cried out: "Drown
them!&mdash;drown them! throw them into the Seyon&mdash;these Lutheran
dogs, who have despised the Host!"<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> In fact, the priests
were beginning to drag the two heretics towards the bridge.
Never was Farel nearer death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ILL-TREATMENT OF FAREL.</div>

<p>On a sudden, from behind the last rock that hides Valangin
in the direction of the mountain, there appeared "certain
good persons of the Val de Ruz coming from Neuchatel"<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a>
and descending into the valley. "What are you doing?"
asked they of the priests, with the intention no doubt of
saving Farel; "put them rather in a place of safety, that
they may answer for their proceedings? Would you deprive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
yourselves of the only means in your power of discovering
those infected by the poison of heresy?"</p>

<p>The priests left off at these words, and conducted the prisoners
to the castle. As they were passing before a little
chapel, containing an image of the Virgin, "Kneel down,"
said they to Farel and Boyve, showing them the statue;
"prostrate yourselves before Our Lady!" Farel began to
admonish them; "Worship one God alone in spirit and in
truth," said he to them, "and not dumb images without life
or power." But they, continues the chronicle, "greatly
vexed at his words and his firmness, inflicted on him so many
blows, that he was covered with blood, which even spirted on
the walls of the chapel. For a long time after the traces of
it might still be seen."<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a></p>

<p>They resumed their march&mdash;they entered the town&mdash;they
climbed the steep road that led to the esplanade where Guillemette
de Vergy and her attendants waited for the "Lutherans;"
so that, continues the chronicle, "from beating them
thus continually, they conducted them all covered with filth
and blood to the prisons, and let them down almost lifeless
into the dungeon (<i>croton</i>) of the castle of Valangin." Thus
had Paul at Lystra been stoned by the Jews, drawn out of
the city, and left for dead.<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> The Apostles and the Reformers
preached the same doctrine and suffered the same treatment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREL AT NEUCHATEL.</div>

<p>It may perhaps be said, that Farel and Boyve were too violent
in their attack; but the Church of the Middle Ages,
which had fallen back into the legal spirit of Judaism, and
into all the corruptions that flow from it, needed an energetic
opposition to lead it again to the principle of grace. Augustin
and St. Paul reappeared in the Church of the sixteenth
century; and when we read of Boyve rushing in great emotion
on those who were about to worship the bread of the Mass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
may we not recall to mind the action of St Paul, rending his
clothes, and running in among the people, who were desirous
of worshipping "men of like passions with themselves?"<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a></p>

<p>Farel and Boyve, thrust into the dungeons of the castle,
could, like Paul and Silas in the prison at Philippi, "sing
praises unto God." Messire de Bellegarde, ever ready to persecute
the Gospel, was preparing for them a cruel end, when
some townsmen of Neuchatel arrived to claim them. Madame
de Valangin dared not refuse, and at the demand of
the Bernese even instituted an inquiry, "to put a good face
on the matter," says a manuscript. "Nevertheless that priest
who had beaten Farel most, never after failed to eat daily at
the lady's table, by way of recompense."<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> But this was of
little consequence: the seed of truth had been sown in the Val
de Ruz.</p>

<p>At Neuchatel the Bernese supported the Evangelical citizens.
The governor, whose resources were exhausted, sent
ambassadors to the princess, "begging her to cross the mountains,
to appease her people, who were in terrible trouble in
consequence of this Lutheran religion."<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a></p>

<p>Meantime the ferment increased. The townspeople prayed
the canons to give up the Mass: they refused; whereupon the
citizens presented them their reasons in writing, and begged
them to discuss the question with Farel. Still the same refusal!&mdash;"But,
for goodness' sake, speak either for or against!"
It was all of no use!</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREL IN THE CATHEDRAL.</div>

<p>On Sunday, the 23d of October, Farel, who had returned
to Neuchatel, was preaching at the hospital. He knew that
the magistrates of the city had deliberated on the expediency
of consecrating the cathedral itself to the Evangelical worship.
"What then," said he, "will you not pay as much honour to
the Gospel as the other party does to the Mass?......And
if this superstitious act is celebrated in the high church, shall
not the Gospel be proclaimed there also?" At these words all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
his hearers arose. "To the church!" cried they; "to the
church!" Impetuous men are desirous of putting their heads
to work, to accomplish what the prudence of the burgesses
had proposed.<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> They leave the hospital, and take Farel with
them. They climb the steep street of the castle: in vain
would the canons and their frightened followers stop the
crowd: they force a passage. Convinced that they are advancing
for God's glory, nothing can check them. Insults
and shouts assail them from every side, but in the name of the
Truth they are defending, they proceed: they open the gates
of the Church of our Lady; they enter, and here a fresh
struggle begins. The canons and their friends assembled
around the pulpit endeavour to stop Farel; but all is useless.
They have not to deal with a band of rioters. God has pronounced
in his Word, and the magistrates themselves have
passed a definitive resolution. The townspeople advance,
therefore, against the sacerdotal coterie; they form a close battalion,
in the centre of which they place the reformer. They
succeed in making their way through the opposing crowd, and
at last place the minister in the pulpit without any harm befalling
him.<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a></p>

<p>Immediately all is calm within the church and without;
even the adversaries are silent, and Farel delivers "one of
the most effective sermons he had hitherto preached." Their
eyes are opened; their emotion increases; their hearts are
melted; the most obstinate appear converted; and from every
part of the old church these cries resound: "We will follow
the Evangelical religion, both we and our children, and in it
will we live and die."<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">THE IDOLS DESTROYED.</div>

<p>Suddenly a whirlwind, as it were, sweeps over this multitude,
and stirs it up like a vast sea. Farel's hearers desire
to imitate the pious King Josiah.<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> "If we take away these
idols from before our eyes, will it not be aiding us," said they,
"in taking them from our own hearts? Once these idols
broken, how many souls among our fellow-citizens, now disturbed
and hesitating, will be decided by this striking manifestation
of the truth! We must save them as it were by
fire."<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a></p>

<p>This latter motive decides them, and then begins a scene
that fills the Romanists with horror, and which must, according
to them, bring down the terrible judgment of God on the
city.</p>

<p>The very spot where this takes place would seem to add to
its solemnity. To the north the castle-walls rise above the
pointed crags of the gloomy but picturesque valley of the
Seyon, and the mountain in front of the castle presents to the
eye little more than bare rocks, vines, and black firs. But
to the south, beneath the terrace on which this tumultuous
scene is passing, extend the wide and tranquil waters of the
lake with its fertile and picturesque shores; and in the distance
the continuous summits of the higher Alps with their
dazzling snows, their immense glaciers, and gigantic peaks,
lie before the enraptured eye.</p>

<p>On this platform the people of Neuchatel were in commotion,
paying little attention to these noble scenes of nature.
The governor, whose castle adjoined the church, was compelled
to remain an idle spectator of the excesses that he
could not prevent; he was content to leave us a description
of them. "These daring fellows," says he, "seize mattocks,
hatchets, and hammers, and thus march against the images
of the saints." They advance&mdash;they strike the statues and
the altars&mdash;they dash them to pieces. The figures carved in
the fourteenth century by the "imagers" of Count Louis are
not spared; and scarcely do the statues of the counts themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
which were mistaken for idols, escape destruction.
The townspeople collect all these fragments of an idolatrous
worship; they carry them out of the church, and throw them
from the top of the rock. The paintings meet with no better
treatment. "It is the devil," thought they with the early
Christians, "who taught the world this art of statues, images,
and all sorts of likenesses."<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> They tear out the eyes in the
pictures of the saints, and cut off their noses. The crucifix
itself is thrown down, for this wooden figure usurps the homage
that Jesus Christ claims in the heart. One image, the most
venerated of all, still remains: it is our Lady of Mercy, which
Mary of Savoy had presented to the collegiate church; but
Our Lady herself is not spared. A hand more daring than
the rest strikes it, as, in the fourth century, the colossal statue
of Serapis was struck.<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> "They have even bored out the
eyes of Our Lady of Mercy, which the departed lady your
mother had caused to be made," wrote the governor to the
Duchess of Longueville.</p>

<p>The Reformed went still further: they seized the patens
in which lay the <i>corpus Domini</i>, and flung them from the
top of the rock into the torrent; after which, being desirous
of showing that the consecrated wafers are mere bread, and
not God himself, they distributed them one to another and ate
them......At this sight the canons and chaplains could no
longer remain quiet. A cry of horror was heard; they ran
up with their adherents, and opposed force to force. At length
began the struggle that had been so much dreaded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REFLECTIONS.</div>

<p>The provost Oliver of Hochberg, the canons Simon of Neuchatel
and Pontus of Soleilant, all three members of the privy
council, had repaired hastily to the castle, as well as the other
councillors of the princess. Until this moment they had
remained silent spectators of the scene; but when they saw
the two parties were coming to blows, they ordered all "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
supporters of the Evangelical doctrine" to appear before the
governor. This was like trying to chain the winds. Besides,
why should the Reformers stop? They were not acting
without legitimate authority.<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> "Tell the governor," replied
the townspeople haughtily, "that in the concerns of God and
of our souls he has no command over us."<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a></p>

<p>George de Rive then discovered that his authority failed
against a power superior to his own. He must yield, and
save at least some remnants. He hastened therefore to
remove the images that still remained, and to shut them up
in secret chambers. The citizens of Neuchatel allowed him
to execute this measure. "Save your gods," thought they,
"preserve them under strong bars, lest perchance a robber
should deprive you of the objects of your adoration."<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> By
degrees the tumult died away, the popular torrent returned
within its channel, and a little after, in commemoration of
this great day, they inscribed these words on a pillar of the
church:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
<small>L'AN 1530, LE 28 OCTOBRE, FUT OTEE ET ABATTUE L'IDOLATRIE<br />
DE CEANT PAR LES BOURGEOIS.</small><a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a><br />
</p>

<div class="sidenote">PLANS OF THE ROMANISTS.</div>

<p>An immense revolution had been effected. Doubtless it
would have been better if the images had been taken away
and the Gospel substituted in their place with calmness, as at
Zurich; but we must take into consideration the difficulties
that so profound and contested a change brings with it, and
make allowance for the inexperience and excesses inseparable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
from a first explosion. He who should see in this revolution
its excesses only, would betray a singularly narrow mind. It
is the Gospel that triumphed on the esplanade of the castle.
It was no longer a few pictures or legends that were to speak
to the imagination of the Neuchatelans: the revelation of
Christ and of the Apostles, as it had been preserved in the
Holy Scriptures, was restored to them. In place of the mysteries,
symbols, and miracles of Popery, the Reformation
brought them sublime tenets, powerful doctrines, holy and
eternal truths. Instead of a Mass, void of God, and filled
with human puerilities, it restored to them the Supper of our
Lord Jesus Christ, his invisible yet real and mighty presence,
his promises giving peace to the soul, and his Spirit, which
changes the heart, and is a sure pledge of a glorious resurrection.
All is gain in such an exchange.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>VIII. The governor and his trusty friends had not, however,
lost all hope. "It is only a minority," said they at the
castle, "which has taken part in the destruction of the
images; the majority of the nation still obeys the ancient doctrine."
M. de Rive had yet to learn that if, in a popular
movement, only the minority appears, it is in some cases
because the majority, being of the same mind with it, prefers
leaving the action to others. However that may be, the
governor, thinking himself upon sure ground, resolved to put
the preservation of the Mass to the vote. If the majority were
doubtful, the combined influence of the government and clergy
would make it incline to the side of Rome. The friends of
the Reformation perceiving this trick, and feeling the necessity
of securing the integrity of the votes, demanded the presence
of Bernese commissioners. This was at first refused.
But Neuchatel, divided into two hostile parties, might at any
time see her streets run blood: De Rive therefore called
Berne to his aid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GOVERNOR'S DIFFICULTIES.</div>

<p>Anthony Noll and Sulpice Archer, both members of the
council, with Jacques Tribolet, bailiff of the Isle of St. John,
all three devoted to the Reform, made their entry into Neuchatel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
on the 4th November,&mdash;an eventful day for the principality,
and one which would decide on its reformation. The
deputies proceeded to the castle, and there spoke with haughtiness.<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a>
"Their excellencies of Berne," said they to the
governor, "are much astonished that you should oppose the
true and pure Word of God. Desist immediately, or else
your state and lordship may suffer for it."<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a></p>

<p>George de Rive was amazed; he had thought to summon
helpers, and he had found masters. He made, however, an
attempt to escape from the strait in which he was caught.
The Roman-catholic cantons of Lucerne, Friburg, and Soleure,
were also allies of the state. The governor insinuated
to the Bernese deputies, that he might well claim their intervention.
At these words the deputies indignantly arose, and
declared to M. de Rive, that if he did so, he might be the
cause of his sovereign's losing Neuchatel. The governor
saw the impossibility of escaping from the net into which he
had fallen. There remained no alternative but submission,
and to watch the current of events which it was impossible
for him to direct.</p>

<p>It was not thus with the canons and the nobles. Not considering
themselves beaten, they surrounded the Bernese;
and mingling, as they always do in similar cases, religion and
politics, endeavoured to shake them. "Do you not see,"
said they, "that unless we support the spiritual power, we
shall compromise the civil power? The surest bulwark of
the throne is the altar! These men, whose defenders you
have become, are but a handful of mischief-makers: the
majority are for the Mass!"&mdash;"Turn which way you like,"
replied one of the stubborn Bernese, "even though the
majority should be on your side, still you must go that way;
never will our lordships abandon the defenders of the Evangelical
faith."<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">HATRED AND DIVISION.</div>

<p>The people assembled at the castle for the definitive vote.
The destiny of Neuchatel was about to be decided. On one
hand were crowded around the governor the privy council,
the canons, and the most zealous of the Romanists; on the
other were to be seen the four aldermen, the town-council,
and a great number of the citizens, gravely ascending the
steep avenue leading to the government-house, and drawing
up in front of their adversaries. On both sides there was the
same attachment to the faith they had embraced, the same
decision; but around the canons were many anxious minds,
troubled hearts, and downcast eyes, while the friends of the
Reform advanced with uplifted heads, firm looks, and hearts
full of hope.</p>

<p>George de Rive, wishing to gain over their minds, began
to address them. He described the violence with which the
Reformed had broken the images, and thrown down the altars;
"And yet," continued he, "who founded this church? It
was the princess's predecessors, and not the citizens. For
which reason, I demand that all those who have violently
infringed our sovereign's authority, be obliged to restore
what they have taken away, so that the holy Mass, and the
canonical hours may be celebrated anew."<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a></p>

<p>Upon this the <i>prudhommes</i> of Neuchatel advanced. They
were not a troop of young and giddy persons, as the Papists
had pretended; they were grave citizens, whose liberties were
guaranteed, and who had weighed what they had to say.
"By the illumination of the Holy Ghost," replied they, "and
by the holy doctrines of the Gospel, which are taught us in
the pure Word of God, we will show that the Mass is an
abuse, without any utility, and which conduces much more
to the damnation than to the salvation of souls. And we are
ready to prove that by taking away the altars, we have done
nothing that was not right and acceptable to God."<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PROPOSED DELAY.</div>

<p>Thus the two parties met face to face with "great hatred
and division," says the Bernese report. The arbitrators consulted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
together. The governor persisted, feeling that this
movement would decide the future. A few votes would
suffice for the triumph of Rome, and he reckoned on gaining
them by his assurance. "You should understand," said he,
"that the majority of this town, men and women, adhere
firmly to the ancient faith. The others are hot-headed young
soldiers, vain of their persons, and puffed up with the new
doctrine."<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a>&mdash;"Well!" replied the Bernese deputies, "to
prevent all mischief, let us settle this difference by the plurality
of suffrages, in accordance with the treaty of peace
made at Bremgarten between the cantons."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ROMANIST PROTEST.</div>

<p>This was what the Reformed desired. "The vote! the
vote!" cried they according to the expression consecrated to
such cases.<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a> But the lord of Prangins and the priests, who
had desired it when they were alone, shrunk back in the
presence of Berne. "We ask for time," said they. If the
Reformed allowed themselves to be cheated by these dilatory
measures, it was all over. When once the Bernese had
quitted Neuchatel, the governor and the clergy would easily
have the upperhand. They therefore remained firm. "No,
no!" said they, "now!&mdash;no delay!&mdash;not a day! not an
hour!" But the governor, in the face of a proceeding that
would decide the legal fall of Popery, trembled, and obstinately
opposed the cries of the people. The magistrates
were already indignant, the burghers murmured, and the
most violent looked at their swords. "They were resolved
to compel us, sword in hand," wrote the governor to the
princess. A fresh storm was gathering over Neuchatel. Yet
a few more minutes' resistance, and it would burst forth upon
the church, the town, and the castle, destroying not only
statues, images, and altars, but "there would have remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
dead men," said the lord of Rive.<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a> He gave way in trouble
and affright.</p>

<p>At the news of this concession, the partisans of Rome saw
all their danger. They confer, they concert their measures,
and in an instant their resolution is taken: they are resolved
to fight.<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> "My lord," said they, turning to M. de Rive, and
touching the hilt of their swords, "all of us who adhere to
the holy Sacrament are resolved to die martyrs for our holy
faith."<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> This demonstration did not escape the notice of the
young soldiers who had returned from the Genevese war.
One minute more and the swords would have been drawn,
and the platform changed into a battlefield.</p>

<p>Monseigneur de Prangins, more wily than orthodox, shuddered
at the thought. "I cannot suffer it," said he to the
most violent of his party; "such an enterprise would forfeit
my mistress's state and lordship."<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a>&mdash;"I consent," said he to
the Bernese, "to take the votes, with reserve nevertheless of
the sovereignty, rights, and lordship of Madame."&mdash;"And
we," replied the townspeople, "with the reserve of our liberties
and privileges."</p>

<p>The Romanists, seeing the political power they had invoked
now failing them, felt that all was lost. They will save their
honour at least in this great shipwreck; they will subscribe
their names, that posterity may know who had remained
faithful to Rome. These proud supporters of the hierarchy
advance towards the governor; tears course down their rough
cheeks, betraying thus their stifled anger. They write their
signatures as witnesses at the foot of the solemn testament
that Popery is now drawing up in Neuchatel, in the presence
of the Bernese deputies. They then added, with tears in their
eyes, "that the names and surnames of the good and of the
perverse had been written in perpetual memory, and declared
that they were still good and faithful burghers of Madame,
and would do her service unto death."<a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">MAJORITY FOR REFORM.</div>

<p>The reformed townspeople were convinced that it was only
by frankly bearing testimony to their religious convictions
that they could discharge their debt before God, their sovereign,
and their fellow-citizens. So that the Catholics had
scarcely protested their fidelity towards their lady, when,
turning towards the governor, the Reformed cried out: "We
say the same in every other thing in which it shall please our
Mistress to command us, save and except the Evangelical
faith, in which we will live and die."<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a></p>

<p>Everything was then prepared for taking the votes. The
church of our lady was opened, and the two parties advanced
between the shattered altars, torn pictures, mutilated statues,
and all those ruins of Popery, which clearly foretold to its
partisans the last and irrevocable defeat it was about to
undergo. The three Lords of Berne took their station beside
the governor as arbitrators of the proceedings and presidents
of the assembly, and the voting began.</p>

<p>George de Rive, notwithstanding the despondency of his
friends, was not altogether without hope. All the partisans
of the ancient worship in Neuchatel had been forewarned;
and but a few days previously the Reformed themselves, by
refusing the voting, had acknowledged the numerical superiority
of their adversaries. But the friends of the Gospel in
Neuchatel had a courage and a hope that seemed to repose
on a firmer basis. Were they not the victorious party, and
could they be vanquished in the midst of their triumph?</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROTESTANTISM PERPETUAL.</div>

<p>The two parties, however, moved forward, confounded one
with the other, and each man gave his vote in silence. They
counted each other: the result appeared uncertain; fear
froze each party by turns. At length the majority seemed
to declare itself;&mdash;they took out the votes,&mdash;the result was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
proclaimed. A majority of eighteen voices gave the victory
to the Reformation, and the last blow to the Papacy!</p>

<p>The Bernese lords immediately hastened to profit by this
advantage. "Live henceforth," said they, "in good understanding
with one another; let the Mass be no longer celebrated;
let no injury be done to the priests; and pay to your
Lady, or to whomsoever they may be justly due, all tithes,
quit-rent, cense, and revenues." These different points were
proclaimed by the assembly, and a report was immediately
drawn up, to which the deputies, the governors, and the
magistrates of the city of Neuchatel affixed their respective
seals.<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE IMAGE OF ST. JOHN.</div>

<p>Farel did not appear in all this business: one might have
said that the reformer was not at Neuchatel: the citizens
appealed only to the Word of God; and the governor himself,
in his long report to the princess, does not once mention him.
It was the Apostles of our Lord, St. Peter, St. John, St. Paul,
and St. James, who by their divine writings re-established
the true foundations of the Church in the midst of the people
of Neuchatel. The Word of God was the law of the prudhommes
of Neuchatel. In vain will the Roman Church say,
"But these very Scriptures,&mdash;it is I who give them to you;
you cannot therefore believe in them without believing in me."
It is not from the Church of Rome that the Protestant Church
receives the Bible. Protestantism has always existed in the
Church. It has existed alone in every place where men
have been engaged in the study of the Holy Scriptures, of
their divine origin, of their interpretation, and in their dissemination.
The Protestantism of the sixteenth century received
the Bible from the Protestantism of every age. When
Rome speaks of the hierarchy, she is on her own ground: as
soon as she speaks of the Scriptures, she is on ours. If Farel
had been put forward in Neuchatel, he would not perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
have been able to stand against the Pope; but the Word of
Christ alone was concerned, and Rome must fall before Jesus.</p>

<p>Thus terminated, by a mutual contract, that day at first so
threatening. If the Reformed had sacrificed any of their
convictions to a false peace, disorder would have been perpetuated
in Neuchatel. A bold manifestation of the truth and
the inevitable shocks that accompanied it, far from destroying
society, preserved it. This manifestation is the wind that lifts
the vessel from the rocks and brings it into the harbour.</p>

<p>The Lord of Prangins felt that, between fellow-citizens,
"it is better to touch one another, even if it be by collision,
than to avoid each other continually." The free explanation
that had taken place had rendered the opposition of the two
parties less irritating. "I give my promise," said the governor,
"to undertake nothing against the vote of this day, for
I am myself a witness that it has been honest, upright, without
danger, and without coercion."<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a></p>

<p>It was necessary to dispose of the spoils of the vanquished
party: the governor opened the castle to them. Thither
were transported the relics, the ornaments of the altars, the
church papers, and even the organ; and the Mass, expelled
from the city, was there mournfully chanted every day.</p>

<p>All the ornaments, however, did not take this road. Some
days after, as two citizens, named Fauche and Sauge, were
going out together to their vineyards, they passed a little
chapel, in which the latter had set up a wooden figure of St.
John. He said to his companion, "There is an image I shall
heat my stove with to-morrow." And, in fact, as he returned,
he carried away the saint and laid it down in front of his
house.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A MIRACLE.</div>

<p>The next morning he took the image and put it on the fire.
Immediately a horrible explosion spread dismay through this
humbly family. The trembling Fauche doubts not that it is
a miracle of the saint, and hastens to return to the Mass. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
vain does his neighbour Sauge protest to him upon oath that,
during the night, he had made a hole in the statue, filled it
with gunpowder, and closed it up again. Fauche will listen
to nothing, and resolves to flee from the vengeance of the
saints. He went and settled with his family at Morteau in
Franche Comté.<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a> Such are the miracles upon which the
divinity of Rome reposes!</p>

<p>By degrees everything became settled: some of the canons,
as Jacques Baillod, William de Pury, and Benedict Chambrier,
embraced the Reformation. Others were recommended
by the governor to the priory of Motiers, in the Val de
Travers; and, in the middle of November, at the time when
the winds begin to rage among the mountains, several canons,
surrounded by a few singing-boys,&mdash;sad relics of the ancient,
powerful, rich, voluptuous, and haughty chapter of Neuchatel,
painfully climbed up the gorges of the Jura, and went to conceal
in these lofty and picturesque valleys the disgrace of a
defeat, which their long disorders and their insupportable
tyranny had but too justly provoked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POPERY AND THE GOSPEL.</div>

<p>During this time the new worship was organized. In room
of the high-altar were substituted two marble tables to receive
the bread and wine; and the Word of God was preached
from a pulpit stripped of every ornament. The pre-eminence
of the Word, which characterizes the Evangelical worship,
replaced in the church of Neuchatel the preeminence of the
sacrament, which characterizes Popery. Towards the end
of the second century, Rome, that ancient metropolis of all
religions, after having welcomed the Christian worship in its
primitive purity, had gradually transformed it into mysteries;
a magic power had been ascribed to certain forms; and the
reign of the sacrifice offered by the priest had succeeded to
the reign of the Word of God. The preaching of Farel had
restored the Word to the rights which belong to it; and
those vaulted roofs, which the piety of Count Ulric II. had,
on his return from Jerusalem, dedicated to the worship of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
Virgin, served at last, after four centuries, to nourish the
faithful, as in the time of the Apostles, "in the words of faith
and of good doctrine."<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a></p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>IX. The convention, drawn up under the mediation of
Berne, stipulated that "the change should take place only in
the city and parish of Neuchatel." Must the rest of the
country remain in darkness? This was not Farel's wish,
and the zeal of the citizens, in its first fervour, effectually
seconded him. They visited the surrounding villages, exhorting
some, combating others. Those who were compelled to
labour with their hands during the day went thither at night.
"Now, I am informed," writes the governor to the princess,
"that they are working at a reformation night and day."</p>

<p>George de Rive, in alarm, convoked the magistrates of all
the districts in the earldom. These good folks believed that
their consciences, as well as their places, depended upon
Madame de Longueville. Affrighted at the thought of freely
receiving a new conviction from the Word of God, they were
quite ready to accept it from the countess as they would a
new impost. A sad helotism, in which religion springs from
the soil, instead of descending from heaven! "We desire to
live and die under the protection of our lady," said the magistrates
to the Lord of Rive, "without changing the ancient
faith, <i>until it be so ordered by her</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> Rome, even after her
fall, could not receive a deeper insult.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAILURE OF THE PLOT.</div>

<p>These assurances of fidelity and the absence of the Bernese
restored De Rive's confidence, and he secretly prepared a
reaction among the nobles and the lower classes. There is
in every historical catastrophe, in the fall of great establishments,
and in the spectacle of their ruins, something which
excites and improves the mind. This was what happened at
the period in question. Some were more zealous for Popery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
after its fall than in its day of power. The priests gliding
into the houses said Mass to a few friends mysteriously called
together around a temporary altar. If a child was born,
the priest noiselessly arrived, breathed on the infant, made the
sign of the cross on its forehead and breast, and baptized it
according to the Roman ritual.<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> Thus they were rebuilding
in secret what had been overthrown in the light of day. At
length a counter-revolution was agreed upon; and Christmas
day was selected for the restoration of Roman-catholicism.
While the Christians' songs of joy should be rising to heaven,
the partisans of Rome were to rush into the church, expel the
heretical assembly, overthrow the pulpit and the holy table,
restore the images, and celebrate the Mass in triumph. Such
was the plan of the Neuchatelan vespers.<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a></p>

<p>The plot got wind. Deputies from Berne arrived at Neuchatel
on the very eve of the festival. "You must see to
this," said they to the governor: "if the Reformed are attacked,
we, their co-burghers, will protect them with all our power."
The conspirators laid down their arms, and the Christmas
hymns were not disturbed.</p>

<p>This signal deliverance augmented the devotion and zeal of
the friends of the Gospel. Already Emer Beynon of Serrière,
where Farel had one day landed from a small boat,
ascending the pulpit, had said to his parishioners: "If I have
been a good priest, I desire by the grace of God to be a still
better pastor." It was necessary for these words to be heard
from every pulpit. Farel recommenced a career of labours,
fatigues, and struggles, which the actions of the apostles and
missionaries alone can equal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREL'S LABOURS.</div>

<p>Towards the end of the year 1530, he crossed the mountain
in the middle of winter, entered the church of Valangin, went
into the pulpit, and began to preach at the very moment that
Guillemette de Vergy was coming to Mass. She endeavoured
to shut the reformer's mouth, but in vain, and the aged and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
noble dowager retired precipitately, saying: "I do not think
this is according to the old Gospels; if there are any new
ones that encourage this, I am quite amazed."<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> The people
of Valangin embraced the Gospel. The affrighted lieutenant
ran to Neuchatel, thence to Berne, and on the 11th February
1521 laid his complaint before the council; but all was
useless. "Why," said their excellencies of Berne to him,
"why should you disturb the water of the river? let it flow
freely on."</p>

<p>Farel immediately turned to the parishes on the slopes between
the lake and Mount Jura. At Corcelles a fanatic crowd,
well armed and led on by the curate of Neuchatel, rushed
into the church where the minister was preaching, and he
did not escape without a wound. At Bevay, the abbot John
of Livron and his monks collected a numerous body of friends,
surrounded the church, and having thus completed the blockade,
entered the building, dragged the minister from the pulpit,
and drove him out with blows and insults. Each time he
reappeared, they pursued him as far as Auvernier with stones
and gunshots.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PASTOR MARCOURT.</div>

<p>While Farel was thus preaching in the plain, he sent one of
his brethren into the valley; it was John de Bély, a man of
good family from Crest in Dauphiny. Beyond Valangin, at
a little distance from Fontaine, on the left side of the road to
Cernier, was a stone that remains to this day. It was here in
the open air, as if in a magnificent temple, that this herald
of the Gospel began to proclaim salvation by grace.<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> Before
him stretched the declivity of Chaumont, dotted with the
pretty villages of Fenin, Villars, Sole, and Savagnier, and
beyond, where the mountains fell away, might be seen the
distant and picturesque chain of the Alps. The most zealous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
of his hearers entreated him to enter the church. He did so;
but suddenly the priest and his curate "arrived with great
noise." They proceeded to the pulpit, dragged Bély down;
and then turning to the women and young persons of the
place, "excited them to beat him and drive him away."<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a></p>

<p>John de Bély returned to Neuchatel, hooted and bruised,
like his friend after the affair at Valangin; but these evangelists
followed the traces of the Apostle Paul, whom neither
whips nor scourges could arrest.<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> De Bély often returned
to Fontaine. The Mass was abolished erelong in this village;
Bély was its pastor for twenty-seven years; his descendants
have more than once exercised the ministry there, and now
they form the most numerous family of agriculturists in the
place.</p>

<p>Farel, after evangelizing the shores of the lake to the south
of Neuchatel, had gone to the north and preached at St.
Blaise. The populace, stirred up by the priests and the lieutenant,
had fallen upon him, and Farel escaped from their
hands, severely beaten, spitting blood, and scarcely recognisable.
His friends had thrown him hurriedly into a boat,
and conveyed him to Morat, where his wounds detained him
for some time.<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a></p>

<p>At the report of this violence the reformed Neuchatelans
felt their blood boil. If the lieutenant, the priest, and his flock
have bruised the body of Christ's servant, which is truly the
altar of the living God, why should they spare dead idols?
Immediately they rush to St. Blaise, throw down the images,
and do the same at the abbey of Fontaine-André,&mdash;a sanctuary
of the ancient worship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISGRACEFUL EXPEDIENT.</div>

<p>The images still existed at Valangin, but their last hour was
about to strike. A Frenchman, Anthony Marcourt, had been
nominated pastor of Neuchatel. Treading in Farel's footsteps,
he repaired with a few of the citizens to Valangin on the
14th June, a great holiday in that town.<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> Scarcely had they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
arrived when a numerous crowd pressed around the minister,
listening to his words. The canons, who were on the watch
in their houses, and Madame de Vergy and M. de Bellegarde
from their towers, sought how they could make a diversion
against this heretical preaching? They could not employ
force because of Berne. They had recourse to a brutal expedient,
worthy of the darkest days of Popery, and which, by
insulting the minister, might divert (they imagined) the attention
of the people, and change it into shouts and laughter. A
canon,<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> assisted by the countess's coachman, went to the
stables and took thence two animals, which they led to the
spot where Marcourt was preaching. We will throw a veil
over this scene: it is one of those disgraceful subjects which
the pen of history refuses to transcribe.<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a> But never did punishment
follow closer upon crime. The conscience of the
hearers was aroused at the sight of this infamous spectacle.
The torrent, that such a proceeding was intended to check,
rushed out of its channel. The indignant people, undertaking
the defence of that religion which their opponents had wished
to insult, entered the church like an avenging wave; the
ancient windows were broken, the shields of the lords were
demolished, the relics scattered about, the books torn, the
images thrown down, and the altar overturned. But this was
not enough: the popular wave, after sweeping out the church,
flowed back again, and dashed against the canons' houses.
Their inhabitants fled in consternation into the forests, and
everything was destroyed in their dwellings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE REFORM ESTABLISHED.</div>

<p>Guillemette de Vergy and M. de Bellegarde, agitated and
trembling behind their battlements, repenting, but too late, of
their monstrous expedient, are the only ones who have not
yet suffered the popular vengeance. Their restless eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
watch the motions of the indignant townspeople. The work
is completed! the last house is sacked! The burghers consult
together.&mdash;O horror!&mdash;they turn towards the castle,&mdash;they
ascend the hill,&mdash;they draw near. Is then the abode of
the noble counts of Arberg about to be laid waste? But no!&mdash;"We
come," said the delegates standing near the gate of the
castle, "we are come to demand justice for the outrage committed
against religion and its minister." They are permitted
to enter, and the trembling countess orders the poor
wretches to be punished who had acted solely by her orders.
But at the same time she sends deputies to Berne, complaining
of the "great insults that had been offered her."<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> Berne
declared that the Reformed should pay for the damage; but
that the countess should grant them the free exercise of their
worship. Jacques Veluzat, a native of Champagne, was the
first pastor of Valangin. A little later we shall see new
struggles at the foot of Mount Jura.</p>

<p>Thus was the Reformation established at Valangin, as it
had been at Neuchatel: the two capitals of these mountains
were gained to the Gospel. Erelong it received a legal sanction.
Francis, Marquis of Rothelin, son of the Duchess of
Longueville, arrived in the principality in March, 1581, with
the intention of playing on this small theatre the part of a
Francis I. But he soon found out that there are revolutions
which an irresistible hand has accomplished, and that must be
submitted to. Rothelin excluded from the estates of the earldom
the canons who had hitherto formed the first power, and
replaced them by four bannerets and four burgesses. Then,
availing himself of the principle that all abandoned property
falls to the state, he laid his hands upon their rich heritage,
and proclaimed freedom of conscience throughout all the
country. All the necessary forms having been observed with
Madame, the politic M. de Rive became reformed also. Such
was the support Rome received from the State, to which she
had looked for her deliverance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GATHERING TEMPEST.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>A great energy characterized the Reformation of French
Switzerland; and this is shown by the events we have just
witnessed. Men have attributed to Farel this distinctive
feature of his work; but no man has ever created his own
times; it is always, on the contrary, the times that create the
man. The greater the epoch, the less do individualities prevail
in it. All the good contained in the events we have just
related came from that Almighty Spirit, of which the strongest
men are but weak instruments. All the evil proceeded from
the character of the people; and, indeed, it was almost
always Popery that began these scenes of violence: Farel
submitted to the influence of his time, rather than the time
received his. A great man may be the personification and
the type of the epoch for which God destines him: he is never
its creator.</p>

<p>But it is time to quit the Jura and its beautiful valleys,
brightened by the vernal sun, to direct our step towards the
Alps of German Switzerland, along which thick clouds and
horrible tempests are beginning to gather. The free and
courageous people, who dwell below the eternal glaciers, or
on the smiling banks of the lakes, daily assume a fiercer
aspect, and the collision threatens to be sudden, violent, and
terrible. We have just been witnessing a glorious conquest:
a dreadful catastrophe awaits us.</p>

<h2>BOOK XVI.</h2>

<h3>SWITZERLAND&mdash;CATASTROPHE. 1528-1531.</h3>


<p>I. It was the will of God that at the very gates of his revived
Church there should be two great examples to serve as lessons
for future generations. Luther and the German Reformation,
declining the aid of the temporal power, rejecting the
force of arms, and looking for victory only in the confession
of the truth, were destined to see their faith crowned with
the most brilliant success; while Zwingle and the Swiss
Reformation, stretching out their hands to the mighty ones of
the earth, and grasping the sword, were fated to witness a
horrible, cruel, and bloody catastrophe fall upon the Word
of God&mdash;a catastrophe which threatened to engulf the Evangelical
cause in the most furious whirlpool. God is a jealous
God, and gives not his glory to another; he claims to
perform his own work himself, and to attain his ends sets
other springs in motion than those of a skilful diplomacy.</p>

<p>We are far from forgetting that we are called upon to relate
facts and not to discuss theories; but there is a principle
which the history we are narrating sets forth in capital letters:
it is that professed in the Gospel, where it says: <span class="smcap">The
weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty
through God!</span> In maintaining this truth we do not place
ourselves on the ground of any particular school, but on that
of universal conscience and of the Word of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE.</div>

<p>Of all carnal support that religion can invoke, there is none
more injurious to it than arms and diplomacy. The latter
throws it into tortuous ways; the former hurries it into paths
of bloodshed; and Religion, from whose brow has been torn
the double wreath of truth and meekness, presents but a degraded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
and humiliated countenance that no person can, that
no person desires to recognise.</p>

<p>It was the very extension of the Reform in Switzerland
that exposed it to the dangers under which it sunk. So long
as it was concentrated at Zurich, it continued a religious
matter; but when it had gained Berne, Basle, Schaffhausen,
St. Gall, Glaris, Appenzell, and numerous bailiwicks, it
formed inter-cantonal relations; and&mdash;here was the error
and misfortune&mdash;while the connexion should have taken place
between church and church, it was formed between state and
state.</p>

<p>As soon as spiritual and political matters became mingled
together, the latter took the upperhand. Zwingle erelong
thought it his duty to examine not only doctrinal, but also
federal questions; and the illustrious reformer might be seen,
unconscious of the snares beneath his feet, precipitating himself
into a course strewn with rocks, at the end of which a
cruel death awaited him.</p>

<p>The primitive Swiss cantons had resigned the right of forming
new alliances without the consent of all; but Zurich and
Berne had reserved the power. Zwingle thought himself
therefore quite at liberty to promote an alliance with the
Evangelical states. Constance was the first city that gave
her adhesion. But this Christian co-burghery, which might
become the germ of a new confederation, immediately raised
up numerous adversaries against Zwingle, even among the
partisans of the Reformation.</p>

<p>There was yet time: Zwingle might withdraw from public
affairs, to occupy himself entirely with those of the Gospel.
But no one in Zurich had, like him, that application to labour,
that correct, keen, and sure eye, so necessary for politicians.
If he retired, the vessel of the state would be left without a
pilot. Besides, he was convinced that political acts alone
could save the Reform. He resolved, therefore, to be at one
and the same time the man of the State and of the Church.
The registers prove that in his latter years he took part in the
most important deliberations; and he was commissioned by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
the council of his canton to write letters, compose proclamations,
and draw up opinions. Already, before the dispute with
Berne, looking upon war as possible, he had traced out a very
detailed plan of defence, the manuscript of which is still in
existence.<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> In 1528 he did still more; he showed in a remarkable
paper, how the republic should act with regard to
the Empire, France, and other European states, and with
respect to the several cantons and bailiwicks. Then, as if
he had grown grey at the head of the Helvetic troops (and
it is but just to remark that he had long lived among soldiers),
he explained the advantages there would be in surprising the
enemy; and he described even the nature of the arms, and
the manner of employing them. In truth, an important revolution
was then taking place in the art of war. The pastor
of Zurich is at once the head of the state and general of the
army: this double&mdash;this triple part of the reformer was the
ruin of the Reformation and of himself. Undoubtedly we
must make allowances for the men of this age, who, being
accustomed to see Rome wield two swords for so many centuries,
did not understand that they must take up one and
leave the other. We must admire the strength of that superior
genius, which, while pursuing a political course, in which
the greatest minds would have been absorbed, ceased not
however to display an indefatigable activity as pastor, preacher,
divine, and author. We must acknowledge that the republican
education of Zwingle had taught him to confound his
country with his religion, and that there was in this great
man enough to fill up many lives. We must appreciate that
indomitable courage which, relying upon justice, feared not,
at a time when Zurich had but one or two weak cities for
allies, to confront the redoubtable forces of the Empire and
of the Confederation; but we should also see in the great and
terrible lesson that God gave him, a precept for all times and
for every nation; and finally, understand what is so often
forgotten, "that the kingdom of Christ is not of this world."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">PERSECUTIONS.</div>

<p>The Roman-catholic cantons, on hearing of the new alliances
of the Reformed, felt a violent indignation. William
of Diesbach, deputy from Berne at the diet, was forced to
submit to the keenest reproaches. The sitting, for some time
interrupted, was resumed immediately after his departure.
"They may try to patch up the old faith," said the Bernese,
as he withdrew, "it cannot, however, last any longer."<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> In
truth, they patched away with all their might, but with a
sharp and envenomed needle that drew blood. Joseph Am
Berg of Schwytz and Jacques Stocker of Zug, bailiffs of
Thurgovia, treated with cruelty all who were attached to the
Gospel. They enforced against them fines, imprisonment,
torture, the scourge, confiscation, and banishment; they cut
out the ministers' tongues, beheaded them, or condemned them
to be burnt.<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> At the same time they took away the Bibles
and all the evangelical books; and if any poor Lutherans,
fleeing from Austria, crossed the Rhine and that low valley
where its calm waters flow between the Alps of the Tyrol and
of Appenzell,&mdash;if these poor creatures, tracked by the lansquenets,
came to seek a refuge in Switzerland, they were
cruelly given up to their persecutors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AUSTRIAN ALLIANCE.</div>

<p>The heavier lay the hands of the bailiff on Thurgovia and
the Rhienthal, the greater conquests did the Gospel make.
The Bishop of Constance wrote to the Five Cantons, that if
they did not act with firmness, all the country would embrace
the Reform. In consequence of this, the cantons convoked at
Frauenfeld all the prelates, nobles, judges, and persons of note
in the district; and a second meeting taking place six days
after (6th December 1528) at Weinfeld, deputies from Berne
and Zurich entreated the assembly to consider the honour of
God above all things, and in no respect to care for the threats
of the world.<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a> A great agitation followed upon this discourse.
At last a majority called for the preaching of the Word of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
God: the people came to the same decision; and the Rheinthal,
as well as Bremgarten, followed this example.</p>

<p>What was to be done? The flood had become hourly
encroaching. Must then the Forest Cantons open their valleys
to it at last? Religious antipathies put an end to national
antipathies; and these proud mountaineers, directing their
looks beyond the Rhine, thought of invoking the succour of
Austria, which they had vanquished at Morgarten and at
Sempach.<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a> The fanatical German party that had crushed
the revolted Swabian peasants was all-powerful on the frontiers.
Letters were exchanged; messengers passed to and
fro across the river; at last they took advantage of a wedding
in high rank that was to take place at Feldkirch in
Swabia, six leagues from Appenzell. On the 16th February
1529, the marriage party, forming a brilliant cavalcade, in
the midst of which the deputies of the Five Cantons were
concealed, made their entry into Feldkirch, and Am Berg
had an immediate interview with the Austrian governor.
"The power of the enemies of our ancient faith has so increased,"
said the Swiss, "that the friends of the Church can resist
them no longer. We therefore turn our eyes to that illustrious
prince who has saved in Germany the faith of our fathers."</p>

<p>This alliance was so very unnatural, that the Austrians had
some difficulty in believing it to be sincere. "Take hostages,"
said the Waldstettes, "write the articles of the treaty
with your own hands; command, and we will obey!"&mdash;"Very
good!" replied the Austrians; "in two months you
find us again at Waldshut, and we will let you know our conditions."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANIMOSITY.</div>

<p>A rumour of these negotiations being spread abroad excited
great dissatisfaction, even in the partisans of Rome. In no
place did it burst out with greater force than in the council
of Zug. The opposing parties were violently agitated; they
stamped their feet, they started from their seats, and were
nearly coming to blows; but hatred prevailed over patriotism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
The Waldstette deputies appeared at Waldshut; they suspended
the arms of their cantons by the side of those of the
oppressors of Switzerland; they decorated their hats with
peacocks' feathers (the badge of Austria), and laughed, drank,
and chattered with the Imperialists. This strange alliance
was at last concluded.<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a> "Whoever shall form new sects
among the people," it ran, "shall be punished with death;
and, if need be, with the help of Austria. This power, in
case of emergency, shall send into Switzerland six thousand
foot soldiers, and four hundred horse, with all requisite artillery.
If necessary, the reformed cantons shall be blockaded,
and all provisions intercepted." To the Romish cantons, then,
belongs the initiative of this measure so much decried. Finally,
Austria guaranteed to the Waldstettes the possession,
not only of the common bailiwicks, but of all the <i>conquests</i>
that might be made on the left bank of the Rhine.</p>

<p>Dejection and consternation immediately pervaded all
Switzerland. The national complaint, which Bullinger has
preserved, was sung in every direction:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wail, Helvetians, wail,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For the peacock's plume of pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the forest-cantons' savage bull<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In friendship is allied.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">CHRISTIAN EXHORTATION.</div>

<p>All the cantons not included in this alliance, with the
exception of Friburg, assembled in diet at Zurich, and
resolved to send a deputation to their mountain confederates,
with a view to reconciliation. The deputation, admitted at
Schwytz in the presence of the people, was able to execute
its mission without tumult. At Zug there was a cry of "No
sermon! no sermon!" At Altorf the answer was: "Would
to God that your new faith was buried for ever!" At Lucerne
they received this haughty reply: "We shall know
how to defend ourselves, our children, and our children's
children, from the poison of your rebellious priests." It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
at Unterwalden that the deputation met with the worst reception.
"We declare our alliance at an end," said they. "It
is we,&mdash;it is the other Waldstettes who are the real Swiss.
We graciously admitted you into our confederation, and now
you claim to become our masters!&mdash;The Emperor, Austria,
France, Savoy, and Valais will assist us!" The deputies
retired in astonishment, shuddering as they passed before the
house of the secretary of state, where they saw the arms of
Zurich, Berne, Basle, and Strasburg hanging from a lofty
gibbet.</p>

<p>The deputation had scarcely returned to Zurich and made
their report, when men's minds were inflamed. Zwingle
proposed to grant no peace to Unterwalden, if it would not
renounce foreign service, the alliance with Austria, and the
government of the common bailiwicks. "No! no!" said
Berne, that had just stifled a civil war in its own canton, "let
us not be so hasty. When the rays of the sun shine forth,
each one wishes to set out; but as soon as it begins to rain,
every man loses heart! The Word of God enjoins peace.
It is not with pikes and lances that faith is made to enter the
heart. For this reason, in the name of our Lord's sufferings,
we entreat you to moderate your anger."</p>

<p>This christian exhortation would have succeeded, if the
fearful news that reached Zurich, on the very day when the
Bernese delivered their moderate speech, had not rendered it
unavailing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KEYSER'S MARTYRDOM.</div>

<p>On Saturday the 22d May, Jacques Keyser, a pastor and
father of a family in the neighbourhood of the Greiffensee,
after coasting the fertile shores of this little lake, crossed the
rich pastures of the bailiwick of Gruningen, passed near the
Teutonic house of Bubikon and the convent of Ruti, and
reached that simple and wild district bathed by the upper
part of Lake Zurich. Making his way to Oberkirk, a parish
in the Gaster district, between the two lakes of Zurich and
Wallenstadt, of which he had been nominated pastor, and
where he was to preach on the morrow, he crossed on foot the
lengthened and rounded flanks of the Buchberg, fronting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
picturesque heights of the Ammon. He was confidently
advancing into those woods which for many weeks he had
often traversed without obstruction, when he was suddenly
seized by six men, posted there to surprise him, and carried
off to Schwytz. "The bailiffs," said they to the magistrates,
"have ordered all innovating ministers to be brought before
the tribunals: here is one that we bring you." Although
Zurich and Glaris interposed; although the government of
Gaster, where Keyser had been taken, did not then belong
to Schwytz; the Landsgemeinde desired a victim, and on the
29th May they condemned the minister to be burnt alive.
On being informed of his sentence, Keyser burst into tears.<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a>
But when the hour of execution arrived, he walked cheerfully
to death, freely confessed his faith, and gave thanks to
the Lord even with his latest breath. "Go and tell them at
Zurich how he thanks us!" said one of the Schwytz magistrates,
with a sarcastic smile, to the Zurich deputies. Thus
had a fresh martyr fallen under the hands of that formidable
power that is "drunk with the blood of the saints."<a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a></p>

<p>The cup was full. The flames of Keyser's pile became
the signal of war. Exasperated Zurich uttered a cry that
resounded through all the confederation. Zwingle above all
called for energetic measures. Everywhere,&mdash;in the streets,
in the councils, and even in the pulpits,&mdash;he surpassed in
daring even the most valiant captains. He spoke at Zurich,&mdash;he
wrote to Berne. "Let us be firm, and fear not to take
up arms," said he. "This peace, which some desire so much,
is not peace, but war: while the war that we call for is not
war but peace.<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a> We thirst for no man's blood, but we will
clip the wings of the oligarchy.<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> If we shun it, the truth
of the Gospel and the ministers' lives will never be secure
among us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE'S ERROR.</div>

<p>Thus spoke Zwingle. In every part of Europe he beheld
the mighty ones of the earth aiding one another to stifle the
reviving animation of the Church; and he thought that without
some decisive and energetic movement, Christianity, overwhelmed
by so many blows, would soon fall back into its
ancient slavery. Luther under similar circumstances arrested
the swords ready to be crossed, and demanded that the Word
of God alone should appear on the field of battle. Zwingle
thought not thus. In his opinion war was not revolt, for
Switzerland had no master. "Undoubtedly," said he, "we
must trust in God alone; but when He gives us a just cause,
we must also know how to defend it, and, like Joshua and
Gideon, shed blood in behalf of our country and our God."</p>

<p>If we adopt the principles of justice which govern the
rulers of nations, the advice of Zwingle was judicious and
irreproachable. It was the duty of the Swiss magistrates to
defend the oppressed against the oppressor. But is not such
language, which might have been suitable in the mouth of a
magistrate, blamable in a minister of Christ? Perhaps
Zwingle forgot his quality of pastor, and considered himself
only as a citizen, consulted by his fellow-citizens; perhaps he
wished to defend Switzerland, and not the Church, by his
counsels; but it is a question if he ought ever to have forgotten
the Church and his ministry. We think we may go
even further; and while granting all that may be urged in
favour of the contrary supposition, we may deny that the
secular power ought ever to interfere with the sword to protect
the faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE AND WAR.</div>

<p>To accomplish his designs, the reformer needed even in
Zurich the greatest unity. But there were many men in that
city devoted to interests and superstitions which were opposed
to him. "How long," had he exclaimed in the pulpit on the
1st December 1528, "will you support in the council these
unbelievers, these impious men, who oppose the Word of
God?"<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a> They had decided upon purging the council, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
required by the reformer; they had examined the citizens
individually; and then had excluded all the hostile members.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>II. On Saturday the 15th June 1529, seven days after
Keyser's martyrdom, all Zurich was in agitation. The moment
was come when Unterwalden should send a governor to
the common bailiwicks; and the images, having been burnt
in those districts, Unterwalden had sworn to take a signal
revenge.<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> Thus the consternation had become general.
"Keyser's pile," thought they, "will be rekindled in all our
villages." Many of the inhabitants flocked to Zurich, and on
their alarmed and agitated features, one might, in imagination,
have seen reflected the flames that had just consumed
the martyr.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WAR OF RELIGION.</div>

<p>These unhappy people found a powerful advocate in Zwingle.
The reformer imagined that he had at last attained the
object that he never ceased to pursue&mdash;the free preaching of
the Gospel in Switzerland. To inflict a final blow would, in
his idea, suffice to bring this enterprise to a favourable issue.
"Greedy pensioners," said Zwingle to the Zurichers, "profit
by the ignorance of the mountaineers to stir up these simple
souls against the friends of the Gospel. Let us therefore be
severe upon these haughty chiefs. The mildness of the lamb
would only serve to render the wolf more ferocious.<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a> Let
us propose to the Five Cantons to allow the free preaching of
the Word of the Lord, to renounce their wicked alliances,
and to punish the abettors of foreign service. As for the
Mass, idols, rites, and superstitions, let no one be forced to
abandon them. It is for the Word of God alone to scatter
with its powerful breath all this idle dust.<a name="FNanchor_1062_1062" id="FNanchor_1062_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a> Be firm, noble
lords, and in despite of certain black horses, as black at Zurich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
as they are at Lucerne,<a name="FNanchor_1063_1063" id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a> but whose malice will never
succeed in overturning the chariot of Reform, we shall clear
this difficult pass, and arrive at the unity of Switzerland and
at unity of faith." Thus Zwingle, while calling for force
against political abuses, asked only liberty for the Gospel;
but he desired a prompt intervention, in order that this liberty
might be secured to it. &OElig;colampadius thought the same:
"It is not a time for delay," said he, "it is not a time for
parsimony and pusillanimity! So long as the venom shall
not be utterly removed from this adder in our bosoms we shall
be exposed to the greatest dangers."<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a></p>

<p>The council of Zurich, led away by the reformer, promised
the bailiwicks to support religious liberty among them; and
scarcely had they learnt that Anthony ab Acker of the Unterwalden
was proceeding to Baden with an army, than they
ordered five hundred men to set out for Bremgarten with four
pieces of artillery. This was the 5th June, and on the same
evening the standard of Zurich waved over the convent of
Mouri.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WAR.</div>

<p>The war of religion had begun. The horn of the Waldstettes
re-echoed afar in the mountains: men were arming in
every direction, and messengers were sent off in haste to
invoke the assistance of the Valais and of Austria. Three
days later (Tuesday the 8th June), six hundred Zurichers,
under the command of Jacques Werdmüller, set out for Rapperschwyl
and the district of Gaster; and, on the morrow,
four thousand men repaired to Cappel, under the command
of the valiant Captain George Berguer, to whom Conrad
Schmidt, pastor of Kussnacht, had been appointed chaplain.
"We do not wish you to go to the war," said Burgomaster
Roust to Zwingle; "for the Pope, the Archduke Ferdinand,
the Romish cantons, the bishops, the abbots, and the prelates
hate you mortally. Stay with the council: we have need of
you."&mdash;"No!" replied Zwingle, who was unwilling to confide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
so important an enterprise to any one; "when my brethren
expose their lives I will not remain quietly at home by
my fireside. Besides, the army also requires a watchful eye,
that looks continually around it." Then, taking down his glittering
halberd, which he had carried (as they say) at Marignan,
and placing it on his shoulder, the reformer mounted his
horse and set out with the army.<a name="FNanchor_1065_1065" id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a> The walls, towers, and
battlements were covered with a crowd of old men, children,
and women, among whom was Anna, Zwingle's wife.</p>

<p>Zurich had called for the aid of Berne; but that city,
whose inhabitants showed little disposition for a religious war,
and which besides was not pleased at seeing the increasing
influence of Zurich, replied, "Since Zurich has begun the
war without us, let her finish it in like manner." The Evangelical
states were disunited at the very moment of struggle.</p>

<p>The Romish cantons did not act thus. It was Zug that
issued the first summons; and the men of Uri, of Schwytz,
and of Unterwalden had immediately begun the march. On
the 8th June, the great banner floated before the townhouse of
Lucerne, and on the next day the army set out to the sound
of the antique horns that Lucerne pretended to have received
from the Emperor Charlemagne.</p>

<p>On the 10th June, the Zurichers, who were posted at Cappel,
sent a herald at daybreak to Zug, who was commissioned,
according to custom, to denounce to the Five Cantons the
rupture of the alliance. Immediately Zug was filled with
cries and alarm. This canton, the smallest in Switzerland,
not having yet received all the confederate contingents, was
not in a condition to defend itself. The people ran to and fro,
sent off messengers, and hastily prepared for battle; the warriors
fitted on their armour, the women shed tears, and the
children shrieked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LANDAMMAN AEBLI.</div>

<p>Already the first division of the Zurich army, amounting to
two thousand men, under the command of William Thöming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
and stationed near the frontier below Cappel, was preparing
to march, when they observed, in the direction of Baar, a
horseman, pressing the flanks of his steed, and galloping
up as fast as the mountain which he had to ascend would
permit. It was Aebli, landamman of Glaris. "The Five
Cantons are prepared," said he, as he arrived, "but I have
prevailed upon them to halt, if you will do the same. For
this reason I entreat my lords and the people of Zurich, for
the love of God and the safety of the Confederation, to suspend
their march at the present moment." As he said these
words, the brave Helvetian shed tears.<a name="FNanchor_1066_1066" id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a> "In a few hours,"
continued he, "I shall be back again. I hope, with God's
grace, to obtain an honourable peace, and to prevent our
cottages from being filled with widows and orphans."</p>

<p>Aebli was known to be an honourable man, friendly to the
Gospel, and opposed to foreign service: his words, therefore,
moved the Zurich captains, who resolved to halt. Zwingle
alone, motionless and uneasy, beheld in his friend's intervention
the machinations of the adversary. Austria, occupied
in repelling the Turks, and unable to succour the Five
Cantons, had exhorted them to peace. This, in Zwingle's
opinion, was the cause of the propositions brought to them
by the landamman of Glaris. So at the moment Aebli
turned round to return to Zug,<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> Zwingle approaching him
said with earnestness, "Gossip landamman, you will render
to God an account of all this. Our adversaries are caught
in a sack: this is why they give you sweet words. By and
by they will fall upon us unawares, and there will be none
to deliver us." Prophetic words, whose fulfilment went beyond
all foresight! "Dear gossip!" replied the landamman,
"I have confidence in God that all will go well. Let each
one do his best." And he departed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BERNESE INTERPOSITION.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>Then, instead of advancing upon Zug, the army began to
erect tents along the edge of the forest and the brink of
the torrent a few paces from the sentinels of the Five Cantons;
while Zwingle, seated in his tent, silent, and in deep
thought, anticipated some distressing news from hour to hour.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. It was the deputies of the Zurich
Council who came to give reality to his fears. Berne,
maintaining the character that it had so often filled as representative
of the federal policy, declared that if Zurich or the
cantons would not make peace, they should know how to
compel them; this state at the same time convoked a diet at
Arau, and sent five thousand men into the field, under the
command of Sebastian Diesbach. Zwingle was struck with
consternation.</p>

<p>Aebli's message, supported by that of Berne, was sent back
by the council to the army; for, according to the principles
of the time, "wherever the banner waves, there is Zurich."
"Let us not be staggered," cried the reformer, ever decided
and firm; "our destiny depends upon our courage; to-day
they beg and entreat, and in a month, when we have laid
down our arms, they will crush us. Let us stand firm in
God. Before all things, let us be just: peace will come
after that." But Zwingle, transformed to a statesman, began
to lose the influence which he had gained as a servant of
God. Many could not understand him, and asked if what
they had heard was really the language of a minister of the
Lord. "Ah!" said one of his friends, who perhaps knew
him best, Oswald Myconius, "Zwingle certainly was an intrepid
man in the midst of danger; but he always had a
horror of blood, even of his most deadly enemies. The
freedom of his country, the virtues of our forefathers, and,
above all, the glory of Christ, were the sole end of his designs.<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a>&mdash;I
speak the truth, as if in the presence of God,"
adds he.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SWISS CORDIALITY.</div>

<p>While Zurich was sending deputies to Arau, the two armies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
received reinforcements. The men of Thurgovia and
St. Gall joined their banners to that of Zurich; the Valaisans
and the men of St. Gothard united with the Romanist
cantons. The advanced posts were in sight of each other at
Thunn, Leematt, and Goldesbrunnen, on the delightful slopes
of the Albis.</p>

<p>Never, perhaps, did Swiss cordiality shine forth brighter
with its ancient lustre. The soldiers called to one another
in a friendly manner, shook hands, styled themselves confederates
and brothers. "We shall not fight," said they. "A
storm is passing over our heads, but we will pray to God, and
he will preserve us from every harm." Scarcity afflicted the
army of the Five Cantons, while abundance reigned in the
camp of Zurich.<a name="FNanchor_1069_1069" id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a> Some young famishing Waldstettes one
day passed the outposts: the Zurichers made them prisoners,
led them to the camp, and then sent them back laden with
provisions, with still greater good-nature than was shown by
Henry IV. at the siege of Paris. At another time, some
warriors of the Five Cantons, having placed a bucket filled
with milk on the frontier line, cried out to the Zurichers that
they had no bread. The latter came down immediately, and
cut their bread into the enemies' milk: then the soldiers of
the two parties began with jokes to eat out of the same dish&mdash;some
on this side, some on that. The Zurichers were delighted
that, notwithstanding the prohibition of their priests,
the Waldstettes ate with heretics. When one of the troop
took a morsel that was on the side of his adversaries, these
sportively struck him with their spoons, and said to him: "Do
not cross the frontier!" Thus did these good Helvetians
make war upon one another; and hence it was that the Burgomaster
Sturm of Strasburg, one of the mediators, exclaimed:
"You Confederates are a singular people! When you are
disunited, you live still in harmony with one another, and
your ancient friendship never slumbers."<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">A CONFERENCE.</div>

<p>The most perfect order reigned in the camp of Zurich.
Every day Zwingle, the commander Schmidt, Zink abbot of
Cappel, or some other minister, preached among the soldiers.
No oath or dispute was heard; every disorderly woman was
turned out of the camp; prayers were offered up before and
after every meal; and each man obeyed his chiefs. There
were no dice, no cards, no games calculated to excite quarrels;
but psalms, hymns, national songs, bodily exercise,
wrestling, or pitching the stone, were the military recreations
of the Zurichers.<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> The spirit that animated the reformer
had passed into the army.</p>

<p>The assembly at Arau, transported to Steinhausen in the
neighbourhood of the two camps, decreed that each army
should hear the complaints of the opposite party. The
reception of the deputies of the Five Cantons by the Zurichers
was tolerably calm; it was not so in the other camp.</p>

<p>On the 15th June, fifty Zurichers, surrounded by a crowd
of peasants, proceeded on horseback to the Waldstettes. The
sound of the trumpet, the roll of the drum, and repeated salvos
of artillery announced their arrival. Nearly twelve thousand
men of the smaller cantons, in good order, with uplifted heads
and arrogant looks, were under arms. Escher of Zurich
spoke first, and many persons from the rural districts enumerated
their grievances after him, which the Waldstettes thought
exaggerated. "When have we ever refused you the federal
right?" asked they. "Yes, yes!" replied Funk, Zwingle's
friend; "we know how you exercise it. That pastor (Keyser)
appealed to it, and you referred him&mdash;to the executioner!"
"Funk, you would have done better to have held your tongue,"
said one of his friends. But the words had slipped out; a
dreadful tumult suddenly arose; all the army of the Waldstettes
was in agitation; the most prudent begged the
Zurichers to retire promptly, and protected their departure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PEACE RESTORED.</div>

<p>At length the treaty was concluded on the 26th June 1529.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
Zwingle did not obtain all he desired. Instead of the free
preaching of the Word of God, the treaty stipulated only
liberty of conscience; it declared that the common bailiwicks
should pronounce for or against the Reform by a
majority of votes. Without decreeing the abolition of foreign
pensions, it was recommended to the Romish cantons to renounce
the alliance formed with Austria; the Five Cantons
were to pay the expenses of the war, Murner to retract his
insulting words, and an indemnity was secured to Keyser's
family.<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a></p>

<p>An incontrovertible success had just crowned the warlike
demonstration of Zurich. The Five Cantons felt it. Gloomy,
irritated, silently champing the bit that had been placed in
their mouths, their chiefs could not decide upon giving up the
deed of their alliance with Austria. Zurich immediately
recalled her troops, the mediators redoubled their solicitations,
and the Bernese exclaimed: "If you do not deliver up
this document, we will ourselves go in procession and tear
it from your archives." At last it was brought to Cappel on
the 26th June, two hours after midnight. All the army was
drawn out at eleven in the forenoon, and they began to read
the treaty. The Zurichers looked with astonishment at its
breadth and excessive length, and the nine seals which had
been affixed, one of which was in gold. But scarcely had a
few words been read, when Aebli, snatching the parchment,
cried out: "Enough, enough!"&mdash;"Read it, read it!" said
the Zurichers; "we desire to learn their treason!" But the
Bailiff of Glaris replied boldly: "I would rather be cut in a
thousand pieces than permit it." Then dashing his knife
into the parchment, he cut it in pieces in the presence of
Zwingle and the soldiers,<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> and threw the fragments to the
secretary to commit them to the flames. "This paper was
not Swiss," says Bullinger with sublime simplicity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE'S HYMN.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>The banners were immediately struck. The men of
Unterwalden retired in anger; those of Schwytz swore they
would for ever preserve their ancient faith; while the troops
of Zurich returned in triumph to their homes. But the most
opposite thoughts agitated Zwingle's mind. "I hope," said
he, doing violence to his feelings, "that we bring back an
honourable peace to our dwellings. It was not to shed blood
that we set out.<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> God has once again shown the great ones
of the earth that they can do nothing against us." But when
he gave way to his natural disposition, a very different order
of thoughts took possession of his mind. He was seen walking
apart in deep dejection, and anticipating the most gloomy
future. In vain did the people surround him with joyful
shouts. "This peace," said he, "which you consider a triumph,
you will soon repent of, striking your breasts." It was
at this time that, venting his sorrow, he composed, as he was
descending the Albis, a celebrated hymn often repeated to the
sound of music in the fields of Switzerland, among the
burghers of the Confederate cities, and even in the palaces
of kings. The hymns of Luther and of Zwingle play the
same part in the German and Swiss Reformation as the
Psalms in that of France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NUNS OF ST. CATHERINE.</div>

<p>An edict, published in the name of the Confederates, ordered
the revival everywhere of the old friendship and brotherly
concord; but decrees are powerless to work such miracles.</p>

<p>This treaty of peace was nevertheless favourable to the
Reform. No doubt it met with a violent opposition in some
places. The nuns of the vale of St. Catherine in Thurgovia,
deserted by their priests and excited by some noblemen
beyond the Rhine, who styled them in their letters, "Chivalrous
women of the house of God," sang Mass themselves,
and appointed one of their number preacher to the convent.
Certain deputies from the Protestant cantons having had an
interview with them, the abbess and three of the nuns secretly
crossed the river by night, carrying with them the papers of
the monastery and the ornaments of the church. But such
isolated resistance as this was unavailing. Already in 1529
Zwingle was able to hold a synod in Thurgovia, which organized
the church there, and decreed that the property of the
convents should be consecrated to the instruction of pious
young men in sacred learning. Thus concord and peace
seemed at last to be re-established in the Confederation.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<div class="sidenote">CONQUESTS OF REFORM.</div>

<p>III. When, however, the conqueror abandons himself to
his triumph, in that very confidence he often finds destruction.
Zurich and Zwingle were to exemplify this mournful lesson
of history. Taking advantage of the national peace, they redoubled
their exertions for the triumph of the Gospel. This
was a legitimate zeal, but it was not always wisely directed.
To attain the unity of Switzerland by unity of faith was the
object of the Zurichers; but they forgot that, by desiring to
force a unity, it is broken to pieces, and that freedom is the
only medium in which contrary elements can be dissolved,
and a salutary union established. While Rome aims at unity
by anathemas, imprisonment, and the stake, christian truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
demands unity through liberty. And let us not fear that
unity, expanding each individuality beyond measure, will
produce by this means an infinite multiplicity. While we
urge every mind to attach itself to the Word of God, we give
it up to a power capable of restoring its diverging opinions
to a wholesome unity.</p>

<p>Zwingle at first signalized his victory by legitimate conquests.
He advanced with courage. "His eye and his
arm were everywhere." "A few wretched mischief-makers,"
says Salat, a Romanist chronicler, "penetrating into the
Five Cantons, troubled men's souls, distributed their frippery,
scattered everywhere little poems, little tracts, little testaments,
and ceased not from saying that the people ought not
to believe the priests."<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> This was not all; while the Reform
was destined to be confined around the lake of the
Waldstettes to a few fruitless efforts, it made brilliant conquests
among the cantons,&mdash;the allies and subjects of Switzerland;
and all the blows there inflicted on the Papacy re-echoed
among the lofty valleys of the primitive cantons, and
filled them with affright. Nowhere had Popery shown itself
more determined than in the Swiss mountains. A mixture
of Romish despotism and Helvetian roughness existed there.
Rome was resolved to conquer, and yet she beheld her most
important positions successively wrested from her.</p>

<p>In fact, on the 29th September 1529, the citizens of
Schaffhausen removed the "great God" (<i>le bon Dieu</i>) from
the cathedral, to the deep regret of a small number of devotees,
whom the Roman worship still counted in this city;
then they abolished the Mass, and stretched out their hands
to Zurich and to Berne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PRIEST OF ZURZACK.</div>

<p>At Zurzack, near the confluence of the Rhine and the Aar,
at the moment when the priest of the place, a man devoted to
the ancient worship, was preaching with zeal, a person named
Tüfel (devil), raising his head, said to him: "Sir, you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
heaping insults on good men, and you are loading the Pope
and the saints of the Roman calendar with honour; pray,
where do we find that in the Holy Scriptures?" This question,
put in a serious tone of voice, raised a sly smile on many
faces, and the people with their eyes fixed on the pulpit
awaited the reply. The curate in astonishment and at his
wit's end, answered with a trembling voice: "Devil is thy
name; thou actest like the devil, and thou art the devil!
For this reason I will have nothing to do with thee." Then
hastily leaving the pulpit, he ran away as if Satan himself
had been behind him. Immediately the images were torn
down, and the Mass abolished. The Roman-catholics sought
to console themselves by repeating everywhere: "At Zurzack
it was the devil who introduced the Reformation."<a name="FNanchor_1076_1076" id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">REFORM IN GLARIS.</div>

<p>The priests and warriors of the Forest Cantons beheld the
overthrow of the Romish faith in countries that lay nearer
to them. In the canton of Glaris, whence by the steep
passes of the Klaus and the Pragel,<a name="FNanchor_1077_1077" id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a> the Reform might suddenly
fall upon Uri and Schwytz, two men met face to face.
At Mollis, Fridolin Brunner, questioning himself every day
by what means he could advance the cause of Christ,<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> attacked
the abuses of the Church with the energy of his
friend Zwingle,<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a> and endeavoured to spread among the
people, who were passionately fond of war, the peace and
charity of the Gospel. At Glaris, on the contrary, Valentine
Tschudi studied with all the circumspection of his friend
Erasmus to preserve a just medium between Rome and the
Reform. And although,&mdash;thanks to the preaching of
Fridolin!&mdash;the doctrines of purgatory, indulgences, meritorious
works, and intercession of the saints, were looked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
by the Glaronais as mere follies and fables,<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a> they still believed
with Tschudi that the body and blood of Christ were
substantially in the bread of the Lord's Supper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITALIAN BAILIWICKS.</div>

<p>At the same time a movement in opposition to the Reform
was taking place in that high and savage valley, where the
Linth, roaring at the foot of vast rocks with jagged crests&mdash;enormous
citadels which seemed built in the air,&mdash;bathes
the villages of Schwanden and Ruti with its waters. The Roman-catholics,
alarmed at the progress of the Gospel, and
wishing to save these mountains at least, had scattered with
liberal hands the money they derived from their foreign
pensions; and from that time violent hatred had been seen
to divide old friends, and men who appeared to have been won
over to the Gospel basely sought for a pretext to conceal a
disgraceful flight.<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> "Peter<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> and I," wrote Rasdorfer, pastor
of Ruti, in despair, "are labouring in the vineyard, but,
alas! the grapes we gather are not employed for the sacrifice,
and the very birds do not eat them. We fish, but after having
toiled all night, we find that we have only caught leeches.<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a>
Alas! we are casting pearls before dogs, and roses before
swine!" This spirit of revolt against the Gospel soon descended
from these valleys with the noisy waters of the Linth
as far as Glaris and Mollis. "The council, as if it had been
composed only of silly women, shifted its sails every day,"
said Rasdorfer;<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> "one day it will have the cowl, on the
next it will not."<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> Glaris, like a leaf carried along by one
of its torrents, and which the waves and eddies drive in different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
directions, wavered, wheeled about, and was nearly
being swallowed up.</p>

<p>But this crisis came to an end: the Gospel suddenly
regained strength, and on Easter Monday 1530, a general
assembly of the people "put the Mass and the altars to the
vote." A powerful party that relied upon the Five Cantons
vainly opposed the Reform. It was proclaimed, and its vanquished
and disconcerted enemies were forced to content
themselves, says Bullinger, with mysteriously concealing a
few idols, which they reserved for better days.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the Reform advanced in the exterior
<i>Rhodes</i> of Appenzell,<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a> and in the district of Sargans. But
what most exasperated the cantons that remained faithful to
the Romish doctrines, was to see it pass the Alps and appear
in Italy, in those beautiful districts round Lake Maggiore,
where, near the embouchure of the Maggia, within the walls
of Locarno, in the midst of laurels, pomegranates, and
cypresses, flourished the noble families of Orelli, Muralto,
Magoria, and Duni, and where floated since 1512 the sovereign
standard of the cantons. "What!" said the Waldstettes,
"is it not enough that Zurich and Zwingle infest
Switzerland! They have the impudence to carry their pretended
Reform even into Italy,&mdash;even into the country of the
Pope!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MONK OF COMO.</div>

<p>Great irregularities prevailed there among the clergy:
"Whoever wishes to be damned must become a priest," was
a common saying.<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a> But the Gospel succeeded in making
its way even into that district. A monk of Como, Egidio à
Porta, who had taken the cowl in 1511, against the wishes of
his family,<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> struggled for years in the Augustine convent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
and nowhere found peace for his soul. Motionless, environed,
as it appeared to him, with profound night, he cried
aloud: "Lord, what wilt thou that I should do?" Erelong
the monk of Como thought he heard these words in his heart:
"Go to Ulric Zwingle and he will tell thee." He rose
trembling with emotion. "It is you," wrote he to Zwingle
immediately, "but no! it is not you, it is God who, through
you, will deliver me from the nets of the hunters." "Translate
the New Testament into Italian," replied Zwingle; "I
will undertake to get it printed at Zurich." This is what
Reform did for Italy more than three centuries ago.</p>

<p>Egidio therefore remained. He commenced translating
the Gospel; but at one time he had to beg for the convent,
at another to repeat his "hours," and then to accompany
one of the fathers on his journeys.<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a> Everything that surrounded
him increased his distress. He saw his country reduced
to the greatest misery by desolating wars,&mdash;men formerly
rich, holding out their hands for alms,&mdash;crowds of women
driven by want to the most shameful degradation. He imagined
that a great political deliverance could alone bring
about the religious independence of his fellow-countrymen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MONK OF LOCARNO.</div>

<p>On a sudden he thought that this happy hour was arrived.
He perceived a band of Lutheran lansquenets descending the
Alps. Their serried phalanxes, their threatening looks were
directed towards the banks of the Tiber. At their head
marched Freundsberg, wearing a chain of gold around his
neck, and saying: "If I reach Rome I will make use of it
to hang the Pope." "God wills to save us," wrote Egidio
to Zwingle: "write to the constable;<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> entreat him to deliver
the people over whom he rules,&mdash;to take from the shaven
crowns, whose God is their belly, the wealth which renders
them so proud,&mdash;and to distribute it among the people who
are dying of hunger. Then let each one preach without fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
the pure Word of the Lord.&mdash;The strength of Antichrist is
near its fall!"</p>

<p>Thus, about the end of 1526, Egidio already dreamt of
the Reformation of Italy. From that time his letters cease:
the monk disappeared. There can be no doubt that the arm
of Rome was able to reach him, and that, like so many
others, he was plunged into the gloomy dungeon of some
convent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LETTER TO THE GERMAN CHURCH.</div>

<p>In the spring of 1530, a new epoch commenced for the
Italian bailiwicks. Zurich appointed Jacques Werdmüller
bailiff of Locarno; he was a grave man, respected by all,
and who even in 1524 had kissed the feet of the Pope; he
had since then been won over to the Gospel, and had sat
down at the feet of the Saviour.<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a> "Go," said Zurich, "and
bear yourself like a Christian, and in all that concerns the
Word of God conform to the ordinances." Werdmüller
met with nothing but darkness in every quarter. Yet, in
the midst of this gloom, a feeble glimmering seemed to issue
from a convent situated on the delightful shores of Lake
Maggiore. Among the Carmelites at Locarno was a monk
named Fontana, skilled in the Holy Scriptures, and animated
with the same spirit that had enlightened the monk of Como.
The doctrine of salvation, "without money and without
price," which God proclaims in the Gospel, filled him with
love and joy. "As long as I live," said he, "will I preach
upon the Epistles of St. Paul;"<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> for it was particularly in
these Epistles that he had found the truth. Two monks, of
whose names we are ignorant, shared his sentiments. Fontana
wrote a letter "to all the Church of Christ in Germany,"
which was forwarded to Zwingle. We may imagine
we hear that man of Macedonia, who appeared in a vision to
Paul in the night, calling him to Europe, and saying, "Come
over and help us."<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a>&mdash;"O, trusty and well-beloved of Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
Jesus," cried the monk of Locarno to Germany, "remember
Lazarus, the beggar, in the Gospel,&mdash;remember that humble
Canaanitish woman, longing for the crumbs that fell from
the Lord's table! hungry as David, I have recourse to the
show-bread placed upon the altar. A poor traveller devoured
by thirst, I rush to the springs of living water.<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a>
Plunged in darkness, bathed in tears, we cry to you who
know the mysteries of God to send us by the hands of the
munificent J. Werdmüller all the writings of the divine Zwingle,
of the famous Luther, of the skilful Melancthon, of the
mild &OElig;colampadius, of the ingenious Pomeranus, of the
learned Lambert, of the elegant Brenz, of the penetrating
Bucer, of the studious Leo, of the vigilant Hütten, and of the
other illustrious doctors, if there are any more. Excellent
princes, pivots of the Church, our holy mother, make haste
to deliver from the slavery of Babylon a city of Lombardy
that has not yet known the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We
are but three who have combined together to fight on behalf
of the truth;<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> but it was beneath the blows of a small body
of men, chosen by God, and not by the thousands of Gideon,
that Midian fell. Who knows if from a small spark God may
not cause a great conflagration?"</p>

<p>Thus three men on the banks of the Maggia hoped at that
time to reform Italy. They uttered a call to which, for three
centuries, the Evangelical world has not replied. Zurich,
however, in these days of its strength and of its faith, displayed
a holy boldness, and dared extend her heretical arms
beyond the Alps. Hence, Uri, Schwytz, Unterwalden, and
all the Romanists of Switzerland gave vent to loud and terrible
threats, swearing to arrest even in Zurich itself the
course of these presumptuous invasions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MONKS OF WETTINGEN.</div>

<p>But the Zurichers did not confine themselves to this:
they gave the Confederates more serious cause of fear by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
waging incessant war against the convents,&mdash;those centres
of Ultramontane fanaticism. The extensive monastery of
Wettingen, around which roll the waters of the Limmat, and
which, by its proximity to Zurich, was exposed more than
any other to the breath of Reform, was in violent commotion.
On the 23d August 1529, a great change took place;
the ice was broken and the downfall complete. The monks
ceased to sing Mass; they cut off each other's beards, not
without shedding a few tears; they laid down their frocks
and their hoods, and clothed themselves in becoming secular
dresses.<a name="FNanchor_1096_1096" id="FNanchor_1096_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> Then, in astonishment at this metamorphosis,
they listened devoutly to the sermon which Sebastian Benli
of Zurich came and preached to them, and erelong employed
themselves in propagating the Gospel, and in singing psalms
in German. Thus Wettingen fell into the current of that
river which seemed to be everywhere reviving the Confederation.
The cloister, ceasing to be a house for gaming,
gluttony, and drunkenness, was changed into a school. Two
monks alone in all the monastery remained faithful to the
cowl.</p>

<p>The commander of Mulinen, without troubling himself
about the threats of the Romish cantons, earnestly pressed
the commandery of St. John at Hitzkirch towards the Reformation.
The question was put to the vote, and the majority
declared in favour of the Word of God. "Ah!"
said the commander, "I have been long pushing behind the
chariot."<a name="FNanchor_1097_1097" id="FNanchor_1097_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a> On the 4th September the commandery was reformed.
It was the same with that of Wadenswyl, with the
convent of Pfeffers, and others besides. Even at Mury the
majority declared for the Gospel; but the minority prevailed
through the support of the Five Cantons.<a name="FNanchor_1098_1098" id="FNanchor_1098_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> A new triumph,
and one of greater value, was destined to indemnify the Reform,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
and to raise the indignation of the Waldstettes to the
highest pitch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ABBEY OF ST. GALL.</div>

<p>The Abbot of St. Gall, by his wealth, by the number of
his subjects, and the influence which he exercised in Switzerland,
was one of the most formidable adversaries of the
Gospel. In 1529, therefore, at the moment when the army
of Zurich took the field against the Five Cantons, the Abbot
Francis of Geisberg, in alarm and at the brink of death,
caused himself to be hastily removed into the strong castle
of Rohrschach, not thinking himself secure except within its
walls. Four days after this, the illustrious Vadianus, burgomaster
of St. Gall, entered the convent, and announced the
intention of the people to resume the use of their cathedral-church,
and to remove the images. The monks were astonished
at such audacity, and having in vain protested and
cried for help, put their most precious effects in a place of
safety, and fled to Einsideln.</p>

<p>Among these was Kilian Kouffi, head-steward of the abbey,
a cunning and active monk, and, like Zwingle, a native of
the Tockenburg. Knowing how important it was to find a
successor to the abbot, before the news of his death was
bruited abroad, he came to an understanding with those who
waited on the prelate; and the latter dying on Tuesday in
Holy Week, the meals were carried as usual into his chamber,
and with downcast eyes and low voice the attendants
made every inquiry about his health. While this farce was
going on round the dead body, the monks who had assembled
at Einsideln repaired in all haste to Rapperswyl, in the territory
of St. Gall, and there elected Kilian, who had so skilfully
managed the affair. The new abbot went immediately to
Rohrschach, and on Good Friday he there proclaimed his own
election and the death of his predecessor. Zurich and
Glaris declared they would not recognise him, unless he
could prove by the Holy Scriptures that a monkish life was
in conformity with the Gospel. "We are ready to protect
the house of God," said they; "and it is for this reason we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
require that it be consecrated anew to the Lord. But we do
not forget that it is our duty also to protect the people. It
is in the bosom of a free people that the free Church of Christ
should raise its head." At the same time the ministers of
St. Gall published forty-two theses, in which they asserted
that convents were not "houses of God, but houses of the
devil."<a name="FNanchor_1099_1099" id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a> The abbot, supported by Lucerne and Schwytz,
which with Zurich and Glaris exercised sovereign power in
St. Gall, replied that he would not dispute about rights which
he held from kings and emperors. The two natives of the
Tockenburg, Zwingle and Kilian, were thus struggling
around St. Gall,&mdash;the one claiming the people for the abbey,
and the other the abbey for the people. The army of Zurich
having approached Wyl, Kilian seized upon the treasures
and muniments of the convent, and fled precipitately beyond
the Rhine. Then when peace was concluded, the crafty
monk clothed himself in a secular dress, and crept mysteriously
as far as Einsideln, whence on a sudden he made all
Switzerland re-echo with his cries. Zurich replied only by
publishing in conjunction with Glaris a constitution, by which
a governor, "confirmed in the evangelical faith," should preside
over the district, with a council of twelve members,
while the election of pastors was left to the parishes.<a name="FNanchor_1100_1100" id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> Not
long afterwards, the abbot, expelled and a fugitive, while
crossing a river near Bregentz, fell from his horse, got entangled
in his frock, and was drowned. Of the two combatants
from the Tockenburg, it was Zwingle who gained the
victory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOLEURE.</div>

<p>The convent was put up to sale, and was purchased by the
town of St. Gall, "with the exception," says Bullinger, "of
a detached building, called <i>Hell</i>, where the monks were left
who had not embraced the Reform."<a name="FNanchor_1101_1101" id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a> The time having arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
when the governor sent by Zurich was to give place to
one from Lucerne, the people of St. Gall called upon the
latter to swear to their constitution. "A governor has never
been known," replied he, "to make an oath to peasants; it
is the peasants who should make an oath to the governor!"
Upon this he retired: the Zurich governor remained, and
the indignation of the Five Cantons against Zurich, which
so daringly assisted the people of St. Gall in recovering their
liberties, rose to the highest paroxysm of anger.</p>

<p>A few victories, however, consoled in some degree the
partisans of Rome. Soleure was for a long time one of the
most contested battle fields. The citizens and the learned
were in favour of Reform: the patricians and canons for
Popery. Philip Grotz of Zug was preaching the Gospel
there, and the council having desired to compel him to say
Mass, one hundred Reformed appeared in the hall of assembly
on the 13th September 1529, and with energy called for
liberty of conscience. Zurich and Berne having supported
this demand, it was granted to them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A NEW MIRACLE.</div>

<p>Upon this the most fanatical of the Roman-catholics, exasperated
at the concession, closed the gates of the city, pointed
the guns, and made a show of expelling the friends of the
Reform. The council prepared to punish these agitators,
when the Reformed, willing to set an example of christian
moderation, declared they would forgive them.<a name="FNanchor_1102_1102" id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a> The Great
Council then published throughout the canton that the dominion
of conscience belonging to God alone, and faith being
the free gift of His grace, each one might follow the religion
which he thought best. Thirty-four parishes declared for the
Reformation, and only two for the Mass. Almost all the
rural districts were in favour of the Gospel; but the majority
of the city sided with the Pope.<a name="FNanchor_1103_1103" id="FNanchor_1103_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a> Haller, whom the Reformed
of Soleure had sent for, arrived, and it was a day of triumph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
for them. It was in the middle of winter: "To-day,"
ironically observed one of the Evangelical Christians, "our
patron saint (St. Ours) will sweat!" And in truth&mdash;-oh!
wonderful!&mdash;drops of moisture fell from the holy image.
It was simply a little holy water that had frozen and then
thawed. But the Romanists would listen to no raillery on so
illustrious a prodigy, reminding us of the blood of St. Januarius
at Naples. All the city resounded with piteous cries,&mdash;the
bells were tolled,&mdash;a general procession moved through
the streets,&mdash;and high mass was sung in honour of the
heavenly prince who had shown in so marvellous a manner
the pangs he felt for his dearly beloved. "It is the fat
minister of Berne (Haller) who is the cause of the saint's
alarm," said the devout old women. One of them declared
that she would thrust a knife into his body; and certain
Roman-catholics threatened to go to the Cordeliers' church
and murder the pastors who preached there. Upon this
the Reformed rushed to that church and called for a public
discussion: two hundred of their adversaries posted themselves
at the same time in the church of St. Ours and refused
the discussion. Neither of the two parties was willing to
be the first to abandon the camp in which it was entrenched.
The senate wishing to clear the two churches thus transformed
into citadels, announced that at Martinmas, <i>i. e.</i> nine months
later, a public discussion should take place. But as the
Reformed found the delay too long, both parties remained for
a whole week more under arms. Commerce was interrupted,&mdash;the
public offices were closed&mdash;messengers ran to and fro,&mdash;arrangements
were proposed;&mdash;but the people were so
stiffnecked,<a name="FNanchor_1104_1104" id="FNanchor_1104_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a> that no one would give way. The city was in
a state of siege. At last all were agreed about the discussion,
and the ministers committed four theses to writing, which
the canons immediately attempted to refute.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POPERY TRIUMPHS.</div>

<p>Nevertheless they judged it a still better plan to elude them.
Nothing alarmed the Romanists so much as discussion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
"What need have we of any?" said they. "Do not the
writings of the two parties declare their sentiments?" The
conference was, therefore, put off until the following year.
Many of the Reformed, indignant at these delays, imprudently
quitted the city; and the councils, charmed at this result,
which they were far from expecting, hastily declared that
the people should be free in the canton, but that in the city
no one should attack the Mass. From that time the Reformed
were compelled every Sunday to leave Soleure and repair
to the village of Zuchsweil to hear the Word of God. Thus
Popery, defeated in so many places, triumphed in Soleure.</p>

<p>Zurich and the other reformed cantons attentively watched
these successes of their adversaries, and lent a fearful ear
to the threats of the Roman-catholics, who ceased not from
announcing the intervention of the Emperor; when on a sudden
a report was heard that nine hundred Spaniards had entered
the Grisons; that they were led by the Chatelain of
Musso, recently invested with the title of marquis by Charles
the Fifth; that the chatelain's brother-in-law, Didier d'Embs,
was also marching against the Swiss at the head of three
thousand imperial lansquenets; and that the Emperor himself
was ready to support them with all his forces. The
Grisons uttered a cry of alarm. The Waldstettes remained
motionless; but all the reformed cantons assembled their
troops, and eleven thousand men began their march.<a name="FNanchor_1105_1105" id="FNanchor_1105_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> The
Emperor and the Duke of Milan having soon after decreed
that they would not support the chatelain, this adventurer
beheld his castle rased to the ground, and was compelled
to retire to the banks of the Sesia, giving guarantees of future
tranquillity; while the Swiss soldiers returned to their homes,
fired with indignation against the Five Cantons, who by their
inactivity had infringed the federal alliance.<a name="FNanchor_1106_1106" id="FNanchor_1106_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a> "Our prompt
and energetic resistance," said they, "has undoubtedly baffled
their perfidious designs; but the reaction is only adjourned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
Although the parchment of the Austrian alliance has been
torn in pieces, the alliance itself still exists. The truth has
freed us, but soon the imperial lansquenets will come and try
to place us again under the yoke of slavery."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MINISTERS' ADDRESS.</div>

<p>Thus in consequence of so many violent shocks, the two
parties that divided Switzerland had attained the highest
degree of irritation. The gulf that separated them widened
daily. The clouds&mdash;the forerunners of the tempest&mdash;drove
swiftly along the mountains, and gathered threateningly
above the valleys. Under these circumstances Zwingle and
his friends thought it their duty to raise their voices, and if
possible to avert the storm. Thus Nicholas de Flue had in
former days thrown himself between the hostile parties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AUTONOMY OF THE CHURCH.</div>

<p>On the 5th September 1530, the principal ministers of
Zurich, Berne, Basle, and Strasburg,&mdash;&OElig;colampadius, Capito,
Megander, Leo Juda, and Myconius,&mdash;were assembled
at Zurich in Zwingle's house. Desirous of taking a solemn
step with the Five Cantons, they drew up an address that
was presented to the Confederates at the meeting of the Diet
at Baden. However unfavourable the deputies were, as a
body, to these heretical ministers, they nevertheless listened
to this epistle, but not without signs of impatience and
weariness.<a name="FNanchor_1107_1107" id="FNanchor_1107_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a> "You are aware, gracious lords, that concord
increases the power of states, and that discord overthrows
them.<a name="FNanchor_1108_1108" id="FNanchor_1108_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a> You are yourselves a proof of the first of these
truths. Setting out from a small beginning, you have, by a
good understanding one with another, arrived at a great end.
May God condescend to prevent you also from giving a striking
proof of the second! Whence comes disunion, if not
from selfishness? and how can we destroy this fatal passion,
except by receiving from God the love of the common weal?
For this reason we conjure you to allow the Word of God
to be freely preached among you, as did your pious ancestors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
When has there ever existed a government, even
among the heathens, which saw not that the hand of God alone
upholds a nation? Do not two drops of quicksilver unite so
soon as you remove that which separates them? Away then
with that which separates you from our cities, that is, the
absence of the Word of God; and immediately the Almighty
God will unite us, as our fathers were united. Then placed
in your mountains, as in the centre of Christendom, you will
be an example to it, its protection and its refuge; and after
having passed through this vale of tears, being the terror of
the wicked and the consolation of the faithful, you will at last
be established in eternal happiness."</p>

<p>Thus frankly did these men of God address their brothers,
the Waldstettes. But their voice was not attended to. "The
ministers' sermon is rather long,"<a name="FNanchor_1109_1109" id="FNanchor_1109_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a> said some of the deputies
yawning and stretching their arms, while others pretended to
see in it fresh cause of complaint against the cities.</p>

<p>This proceeding of the ministers was useless: the Waldstettes
rejected the Word of God, which they had been entreated
to admit; they rejected the hands that were extended
towards them in the name of Jesus Christ. They called for
the Pope and not for the Gospel. All hope of reconciliation
appeared lost.</p>

<p>Some persons, however, had at that time a glimpse of
what might have saved Switzerland and the Reformation,&mdash;the
<i>autonomy</i> (self-government) of the Church, and its independence
of political interests. Had they been wise enough
to decline the secular power to secure the triumph of the Gospel,
it is probable that harmony might have been gradually
established in the Helvetic cantons, and that the Gospel would
have conquered by its Divine strength. The power of the
Word of God presented chances of success that were not
afforded by pikes and muskets. The energy of faith, the
influence of charity, would have proved a securer protection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
to Christians against the burning piles of Waldstettes than
diplomatists and men-at-arms. None of the Reformers understood
this so clearly as &OElig;colampadius. His handsome
countenance, the serenity of his features, the mild expression
of his eyes, his long and venerable beard, the spirituality of
his expression, a certain dignity that inspired confidence and
respect, gave him rather the air of an apostle than of a reformer.
It was the power of the inner word that he particularly
extolled; perhaps he even went too far in spiritualism.
But, however that may be, if any man could have saved
Reform from the misfortunes that were about to befall it&mdash;that
man was he. In separating from the Papacy, he desired
not to set up the magistrate in its stead. "The magistrate
who should take away from the churches the authority that
belongs to them," wrote he to Zwingle, "would be more intolerable
than Antichrist himself (<i>i. e.</i> the Pope)."<a name="FNanchor_1110_1110" id="FNanchor_1110_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a>&mdash;"The
hand of the magistrate strikes with the sword, but the hand
of Christ heals. Christ has not said,&mdash;If thy brother will not
hear thee, tell it to the magistrate, but&mdash;<i>tell it to the Church</i>.
The functions of the State are distinct from those of the
Church. The State is free to do many things which the purity
of the Gospel condemns."<a name="FNanchor_1111_1111" id="FNanchor_1111_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a> &OElig;colampadius saw how
important it was that his convictions should prevail among
the Reformed. This man, so mild and so spiritual, feared
not to stand forth boldly in defence of doctrines then so
novel. He expounded them before a synod assembly, and
next developed them before the senate of Basle.<a name="FNanchor_1112_1112" id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a> It is a
strange circumstance that these ideas, for a moment at least,
were acceptable to Zwingle;<a name="FNanchor_1113_1113" id="FNanchor_1113_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a> but they displeased an assembly
of the brethren to whom he communicated them; the
politic Bucer above all feared that this independence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
Church would in some measure check the exercise of the civil

Church, were not, however, entirely unsuccessful. In
February 1531, a diet of four reformed cantons (Basle, Zurich,
Berne, and St. Galls) was held at Basle, in which it
was agreed, that whenever any difficulty should arise with
regard to doctrine or worship, an assembly of divines and laymen
should be convoked, which should examine what the
Word of God said on the matter.<a name="FNanchor_1115_1115" id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> This resolution, by giving
greater unity to the renovated Church, gave it also fresh
strength.</p>

<p>IV. But it was too late to tread in this path, which
would have prevented so many disasters. The Reformation
had already entered with all her sails set upon the stormy
ocean of politics, and terrible misfortunes were gathering over
her. The impulse communicated to the Reform came from
another than &OElig;colampadius. Zwingle's proud and piercing
eyes,&mdash;his harsh features,&mdash;his bold step,&mdash;all proclaimed
in him a resolute mind and the man of action. Nurtured
in the exploits of the heroes of antiquity, he threw himself,
to save Reform, in the footsteps of Demosthenes and Cato,
rather than in those of St. John and St. Paul. His prompt
and penetrating looks were turned to the right and to the
left,&mdash;to the cabinets of kings and the councils of the people,
whilst they should have been directed solely to God. We
have already seen, that as early as 1527, Zwingle, observing
how all the powers were rising against the Reformation, had
conceived the plan of a <i>co-burghery</i> or Christian State,<a name="FNanchor_1116_1116" id="FNanchor_1116_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> which
should unite all the friends of the Word of God in one holy
and powerful league. This was so much the easier, as
Zwingle's reformation had won over Strasburg, Augsburg,
Ulm, Reutlingen, Lindau, Memmingen, and other towns of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
Upper Germany. Constance in December 1527, Berne in
June 1528, St. Gall in November of the same year, Bienne
in 1529, Mulhausen in February, Basle in March, Schaffhausen
in September, and Strasburg in December, entered into
this alliance. This political phase of Zwingle's character
is in the eyes of some persons his highest claim to glory:
we do not hesitate to acknowledge it as his greatest fault.
The Reformer, deserting the paths of the Apostles, allowed
himself to be led astray by the perverse example of Popery.
The primitive Church never opposed their persecutors but
by the dispositions of the Gospel of peace. Faith was the
only sword by which it vanquished the mighty ones of the
earth. Zwingle felt clearly that by entering into the ways
of worldly politicians, he was leaving those of a minister of
Christ: he therefore sought to justify himself. "No doubt,
it is not by human strength," said he, "it is by the strength
of God alone that the Word of the Lord should be upheld.
But God often makes use of men as instruments to succour
men. Let us therefore unite, and from the sources of the
Rhine to Strasburg let us form but one people and one alliance."<a name="FNanchor_1117_1117" id="FNanchor_1117_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE'S DOUBLE PART.</div>

<p>Zwingle played two parts at once&mdash;he was a reformer and
a magistrate. But these are two characters that ought not
more to be united than those of a minister and of a soldier.
We will not blame the soldiers, we will not blame the magistrates;
in forming leagues and drawing the sword, they
act according to their point of view, although it is not the
same as ours; but we will decidedly blame the christian minister,
who becomes a diplomatist or a general.</p>

<p>In October 1529, as we have already observed, Zwingle
repaired to Marburg, whither he had been invited by Philip
of Hesse; and while neither of them had been able to come
to an understanding with Luther, the Landgrave and the
Swiss Reformer, animated by the same bold and enterprising
spirit, soon agreed together.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE AND LUTHER.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>The two reformers differed not less in their political than
in their religious system. Luther, brought up in the cloister
and in monastic submission, was imbued in youth with the
writings of the fathers of the Church; Zwingle, on the
other hand, reared in the midst of Swiss liberty, had, during
those early years which decide the course of all the others,
imbibed the history of the ancient republics. Thus, while
Luther was in favour of a passive obedience, Zwingle demanded
that the tyrants should be opposed.</p>

<p>These two men were the faithful representatives of their
respective nations. In the north of Germany, the princes
and nobility were the essential part of the nation, and the
people&mdash;strangers to all political liberty&mdash;had only to obey.
Thus, at the epoch of the Reformation, they were contented
to follow the voice of their doctors and chiefs. In Switzerland,
in the south of Germany, and on the Rhine, on the
contrary, many cities, after long and violent struggles, had
won their civil liberty; and hence we see in almost every
place the people taking a decided part in the Reform of the
Church. There was good in this; but evil was close at
hand. The Reformers, themselves men of the people, who
dared not act upon princes, might be tempted to hurry away
the people. It was easier for the Reformation to unite with
republics than with kings. This facility nearly proved its
ruin. The Gospel was thus to learn that its alliance is in
heaven.</p>

<div class="sidenote">UNION OF THE STATES.</div>

<p>There was, however, one prince with whom the reformed
party of the free states desired to be in union: this was Philip
of Hesse. It was he who in great measure prompted Zwingle's
warlike projects. Zwingle desired to make him some
return, and to introduce his new friend into the evangelical
league. But Berne, watchful to avert anything that might
irritate the Emperor and its ancient confederates, rejected
this proposal, and thus excited a lively discontent in the
"Christian City."&mdash;"What!" cried they, "do the Bernese
refuse an alliance that would be honourable for us, acceptable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
to Jesus Christ, and terrible to our adversaries?"<a name="FNanchor_1118_1118" id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a>&mdash;"The
Bear," said the high-spirited Zwingle, "is jealous of
the Lion (Zurich); but there will be an end to all these artifices,
and victory will remain with the bold." It would
appear, indeed, according to a letter in cipher, that the Bernese
at last sided with Zwingle, requiring only that this alliance
with a prince of the Empire should not be made public.<a name="FNanchor_1119_1119" id="FNanchor_1119_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a></p>

<p>Still &OElig;colampadius had not given way, and his meekness
contended, although modestly, with the boldness of his impetuous
friend. He was convinced that faith was destined
to triumph only by the cordial union of all believers. A valuable
relief came to reanimate his exertions. The deputies of
the Christian co-burghery, being assembled at Basle in 1530,
the envoys from Strasburg endeavoured to reconcile Luther
and Zwingle. &OElig;colampadius wrote to Zwingle on the subject,
begging him to hasten to Basle,<a name="FNanchor_1120_1120" id="FNanchor_1120_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a> and not show himself
too unyielding. "To say that the body and blood of Christ
are really in the Lord's Supper, may appear to many too
hard an expression," said he, "but is it not softened, when it
is added&mdash;spiritually and not bodily?"<a name="FNanchor_1121_1121" id="FNanchor_1121_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE'S POLITICS.</div>

<p>Zwingle was immovable. "It is to flatter Luther that
you hold such language, and not to defend the truth.<a name="FNanchor_1122_1122" id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a>
<i>Edere est credere.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_1123_1123" id="FNanchor_1123_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a> Nevertheless there were men present
at the meeting, who were resolved upon energetic measures.
Brotherly love was on the eve of triumphing: peace was to be
obtained by union. The Elector of Saxony himself proposed
a concord of all Evangelical Christians: the Landgrave invited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
the Swiss cities to accede to it. A report spread that
Luther and Zwingle were about to make the same confession
of faith. Zwingle, calling to mind the early professions of the
Saxon Reformer, said one day at table before many witnesses,
that Luther would not think so erroneously about the Eucharist,
if he were not misled by Melancthon.<a name="FNanchor_1124_1124" id="FNanchor_1124_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a> The union
of the whole Reform seemed about to be concluded: it would
have vanquished by its own weapons. But Luther soon
showed that Zwingle was mistaken in his expectation. He
required a written engagement by which Zwingle and &OElig;colampadius
should adhere to his sentiments, and the negotiations
were broken off in consequence. Concord having failed,
there remained nothing but war. &OElig;colampadius must be
silent, and Zwingle must act.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS FORESIGHT.</div>

<p>And in truth from that hour Zwingle advanced more and
more along that fatal path into which he was led by his character,
his patriotism, and his early habits. Stunned by so
many violent shocks, attacked by his enemies and by his brethren,
he staggered and his head grew dizzy. From this
period the reformer almost entirely disappears, and we see in
his place the politician, the great citizen, who, beholding a
formidable coalition preparing its chains for every nation,
stands up energetically against it. The Emperor had just
formed a close alliance with the Pope. If his deadly schemes
were not opposed, it would be all over, in Zwingle's opinion,
with the Reformation, with religious and political liberty, and
even with the Confederation itself. "The Emperor," said he,
"is stirring up friend against friend, enemy against enemy:
and then he endeavours to raise out of this confusion the glory
of the Papacy, and above all his own power. He excites the
Chatelain of Musso against the Grisons&mdash;Duke George of Saxony
against Duke John&mdash;the Bishop of Constance against
the city&mdash;the Duke of Savoy against Berne&mdash;the Five Cantons
against Zurich&mdash;and the Bishops of the Rhine against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
the Landgrave; then, when the confusion shall have become
general, he will fall upon Germany, will offer himself as a
mediator, and ensnare princes and cities by fine speeches,
until he has them all under his feet. Alas! what discord,
what disasters, under the pretence of re-establishing the Empire
and restoring religion!"<a name="FNanchor_1125_1125" id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a> Zwingle went farther. The
reformer of a small town in Switzerland, rising to the most
astonishing political conceptions, called for a European alliance
against such fatal designs. The son of a peasant of the
Tockenburg held up his head against the heir of so many
crowns. "That man must either be a traitor or a coward,"
wrote he to a senator of Constance, "who is content to
stretch and yawn, when he ought to be collecting men and
arms on every side, to show the Emperor that in vain he
strives to re-establish the Romish faith, to enslave the free
cities, and to subdue the Helvetians.<a name="FNanchor_1126_1126" id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> He showed us only
six months ago how he would proceed. To-day he will take
one city in hand, to-morrow another; and so, step by step,
until they are all reduced. Then their arms will be taken
away, their treasures, their machines of war, and all their
power......Arouse Lindau, and all your neighbours; if they
do not awake, public liberty will perish under the pretext of
religion. We must place no confidence in the friendship of
tyrants. Demosthenes teaches us that there is nothing so
hateful in their eyes as &#964;&#951;&#957; &#964;&#969;&#957; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#949;&#969;&#957; &#949;&#955;&#949;&#965;&#952;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#945;&#957;.<a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a> The Emperor
with one hand offers us bread, but in the other he conceals
a stone."<a name="FNanchor_1128_1128" id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a> And a few months later Zwingle wrote to
his friends in Constance: "Be bold; fear not the schemes
of Charles. The razor will cut him who is sharpening it."<a name="FNanchor_1129_1129" id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">ADVOCATES RESISTANCE.</div>

<p>Away, then, with delay! Should they wait until Charles the
Fifth claimed the ancient castle of Hapsburg? The Papacy
and the Empire, it was said at Zurich, are so confounded
together,<a name="FNanchor_1130_1130" id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a> that one cannot exist or perish without the other.
Whoever rejects Popery should reject the Empire, and whoever
rejects the Emperor should reject the Pope.</p>

<p>It appears that Zwingle's thoughts even went beyond a simple
resistance. When once the Gospel had ceased to be his
principal study, there was nothing that could arrest him.
"A single individual," said he, "must not take it into his head
to dethrone a tyrant; this would be a revolt, and the kingdom
of God commands peace, righteousness, and joy. But if a
whole people with common accord, or if the majority at least,
rejects him, without committing any excess, it is God himself
who acts."<a name="FNanchor_1131_1131" id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> Charles V. was at that time a tyrant in Zwingle's
eyes; and the reformer hoped that Europe, awakening at
length from its long slumber, would be the hand of God to
hurl him from his throne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EMBASSY TO VENICE.</div>

<p>Never since the time of Demosthenes and of the two Catos
had the world seen a more energetic resistance to the power
of its oppressors. Zwingle in a political point of view is one
of the greatest characters of modern times: we must pay
him this honour, which is, perhaps, for a minister of God, the
greatest reproach. Everything was prepared in his mind to
bring about a revolution that would have changed the history
of Europe. He knew what he desired to substitute in place
of the power he wished to overthrow. He had already cast
his eyes upon the prince who was to wear the imperial crown
instead of Charles. It was his friend the Landgrave. "Most
gracious prince," he wrote on the 2d November 1529, "I
write to you as a child to a father; it is because I hope that
God has chosen you for great events......I dare think, but
I dare not speak of them<a name="FNanchor_1132_1132" id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a>......However, we must bell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
the cat at last.<a name="FNanchor_1133_1133" id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a>......All that I can do with my feeble
means to manifest the truth, to save the Universal Church,
to augment your power and the power of those who love
God&mdash;with God's help, I will do." Thus was this great man
led astray. It is the will of God that there be spots even in
those who shine brightest in the eyes of the world, and that
only one upon earth shall say&mdash;"Which of you convinceth
me of sin?" We are now viewing the faults of the Reformation:
they arise from the union of religion with politics.
I could not take upon myself to pass them by; the recollection
of the errors of our predecessors is perhaps the most useful
legacy they have bequeathed to us.</p>

<p>It appears already that at Marburg Zwingle and the Landgrave
had drawn out the first sketch of a general alliance
Against Charles V. The Landgrave had undertaken to bring
over the princes, Zwingle the free cities of Southern Germany
and Switzerland. He went still further, and formed
a plan of gaining over to this league the republics of Italy&mdash;the
powerful Venice at least&mdash;that she might detain the
Emperor beyond the Alps, and prevent him from leading
all his forces into Germany. Zwingle, who had earnestly
pleaded against all foreign alliances, and proclaimed on so
many occasions that the only ally of the Swiss should be the
arm of the Almighty, began now to look around for what he
had condemned, and thus prepared the way for the terrible
judgment that was about to strike his family, his country,
and his Church.</p>

<p>He had hardly returned from Marburg, and had made no
official communication to the great council, when he obtained
from the senate the nomination of an ambassador to
Venice. Great men, after their first success, easily imagine
that they can do everything. It was not a statesman who
was charged with this mission, but one of Zwingle's friends,
who had accompanied him into Germany, to the court of the
future chief of the Empire&mdash;the Greek professor, Rodolph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
Collin, a bold and skilful man, and who knew Italian. Thus
the Reform stretched its hands to the Doge and the Procurator
of St. Marc. The Bible was not enough for it&mdash;it must have
the <i>Golden Book</i>: never did a greater humiliation befall
God's work. The opinion which Protestants then entertained
of Venice may, however, partly excuse Zwingle.
There was in that city more independence of the Pope, more
freedom of thought, than in all the rest of Italy. Luther
himself about this time wrote to Gabriel Zwilling, pastor
at Torgau: "With what joy do I learn what you write to me
concerning the Venetians. God be praised and glorified, for
that they have received his Word!"<a name="FNanchor_1134_1134" id="FNanchor_1134_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PROJECTED ALLIANCE.</div>

<p>Collin was admitted, on the 26th December, to an audience
with the Doge and senate, who looked with an air of
astonishment at this schoolmaster, this strange ambassador,
without attendants, and without parade. They could not
even understand his credentials, in so singular a style were
they drawn up, and Collin was forced to explain their meaning.
"I am come to you," said he, "in the name of the
council of Zurich and of the cities of the Christian co-burghery&mdash;free
cities like Venice, and to which common interests
should unite you. The power of the Emperor is formidable
to the Republics; he is aiming at a universal monarchy in
Europe; if he succeeds, all the free states will perish. We
must therefore check him."<a name="FNanchor_1135_1135" id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> The Doge replied that the Republic
had just concluded an alliance with the Emperor,
and betrayed the distrust that so mysterious a mission excited
in the Venetian senate. But afterwards, in a private conference,<a name="FNanchor_1136_1136" id="FNanchor_1136_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a>
the Doge, wishing to preserve a retreat on both sides,
added, that Venice gratefully received the message from
Zurich, and that a Venetian regiment, armed and paid by the
Republic itself, should be always ready to support the Evangelical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
Swiss. The chancellor, covered with his purple
robe, attended Collin to the door, and, at the very gates of
the ducal palace, confirmed the promise of support. The
moment the Reformation passed the magnificent porticos of
St. Marc it was seized with giddiness; it could but stagger
onwards to the abyss. They dismissed poor Collin by placing
in his hands a present of twenty crowns. The rumour of
these negotiations soon spread abroad, and the less suspicious,
Capito for example, shook their heads, and could
see in this pretended agreement nothing but the accustomed
perfidy of Venice.<a name="FNanchor_1137_1137" id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a></p>

<p>This was not enough. The cause of the Reform was fated
to drink the cup of degradation to the very dregs. Zwingle,
seeing that his adversaries in the Empire increased daily in
numbers and in power, gradually lost his ancient aversion
for France; and, although there was now a greater obstacle
than before between him and Francis I.,&mdash;the blood of
his brethren shed by that monarch,&mdash;he showed himself
favourably disposed to a union that he had once so forcibly
condemned.</p>

<p>Lambert Maigret, a French general, who appears to have
had some leaning to the Gospel&mdash;which is a slight excuse for
Zwingle&mdash;entered into correspondence with the reformer,
giving him to understand that the secret designs of Charles
V. called for an alliance between the King of France and the
Swiss Republics. "Apply yourself," said this diplomatist
to him in 1530, "to a work so agreeable to our Creator, and
which, by God's grace, will be very easy to your Mightiness."<a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a>
Zwingle was at first astonished at these overtures.
"The King of France," thought he, "cannot know which
way to turn."<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> Twice he took no heed of this prayer; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
the envoy of Francis I. insisted that the reformer should communicate
to him a plan of alliance. At the third attempt of
the ambassador, the simple child of the Tockenburg mountains
could no longer resist his advances. If Charles V.
must fall, it cannot be without French assistance; and why
should not the Reformation contract an alliance with Francis
I., the object of which would be to establish a power in the
Empire that should in its turn oblige the King to tolerate the
Reform in his own dominions? Everything seemed to meet
the wishes of Zwingle; the fall of the tyrant was at hand, and
he would drag the Pope along with him. He communicated
the general's overtures to the secret council, and Collin set
out, commissioned to bear the required project to the French
ambassador.<a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a> "In ancient times," it ran, "no kings or people
ever resisted the Roman Empire with such firmness as
those of France and Switzerland. Let us not degenerate
from the virtues of our ancestors. His most Christian Majesty&mdash;all
whose wishes are, that the purity of the Gospel may
remain undefiled<a name="FNanchor_1141_1141" id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a>&mdash;engages therefore to conclude an alliance
with the Christian co-burghery that shall be in accordance
with the Divine law, and that shall be submitted to the censure
of the evangelical theologians of Switzerland." Then
followed an outline of the different articles of the treaty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">APPROACHING RUIN.</div>

<p>Lanzerant, another of the king's envoys, replied the same
day (27th February) to this astonishing project of alliance
about to be concluded between the reformed Swiss and the
persecutor of the French Reformed, <i>under reserve of the
censure of the theologians</i>......This was not what
France desired: it was Lombardy, and not the Gospel that
the king wanted. For that purpose, he needed the support
of all the Swiss. But an alliance which ranged the Roman-catholic
cantons against him, would not suit him. Being
satisfied, therefore, for the present with knowing the sentiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
of Zurich, the French envoys began to look coolly
upon the Reformer's scheme. "The matters you have submitted
to us are admirably drawn up," said Lanzerant to the
Swiss commissioner, "but I can scarcely understand them,
no doubt because of the weakness of my mind......We
must not put any seed into the ground, unless
the soil be properly prepared for it."</p>

<p>Thus, the Reform acquired nothing but shame from these
propositions. Since it had forgotten these precepts of the
Word of God: "Be ye not unequally yoked together with
unbelievers!"<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a> how could it fail to meet with striking reverses?
Already Zwingle's friends began to abandon him.
The Landgrave, who had pushed him into this diplomatic
career, drew towards Luther, and sought to check the Swiss
Reformer, particularly after this saying of Erasmus had
sounded in the ears of the great: "They ask us to open our
gates, crying aloud&mdash;the Gospel! the Gospel!......Raise

<div class="sidenote">LANDERS.</div>

<p>While the Reform, by its culpable proceedings, was calling
down the chastisement of Heaven, the Five Cantons,
that were to be the instruments of its punishment, accelerated
with all their might those fatal days of anger and
of vengeance. They were irritated at the progress of the
Gospel throughout the Confederation, while the peace they
had signed became every day more irksome to them. "We
shall have no repose," said they, "until we have broken
these bonds and regained our former liberty."<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> A general
diet was convoked at Baden for the 8th January, 1531. The
Five Cantons then declared that if justice was not done to
their grievances, particularly with respect to the abbey of
St. Gall, they would no more appear in diet. "Confederates
of Glaris, Schaffhausen, Friburg, Soleure, and Appenzell,"
cried they, "aid us in making our ancient alliances respected,
or we will ourselves contrive the means of checking this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
guilty violence; and may the Holy Trinity assist us in this
work!"<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">VIOLENCE.</div>

<p>But they did not confine themselves to threats. The treaty
of peace had expressly forbidden all insulting language&mdash;"for
fear," it is said, "that by insults and calumnies, discord
should again be excited, and greater troubles than the former
should arise." Thus was concealed in the treaty itself
the spark whence the conflagration was to proceed. In fact,
to restrain the rude tongues of the Waldstettes was impossible.
Two Zurichers, the aged prior Ravensbühler, and the
pensioner Gaspard Gödli, who had been compelled to renounce,
the one his convent, and the other his pension, especially
aroused the anger of the people against their native city.
They used to say everywhere in these valleys, and with impunity,
that the Zurichers were heretics; that there was not
one of them who did not indulge in unnatural sins, and who
was not a robber at the very least;<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a>&mdash;that Zwingle was
a thief, a murderer, and an arch-heretic; and that, on one
occasion at Paris (where he had never been,) he had committed
a horrible offence, in which Leo Juda had been his
pander.<a name="FNanchor_1146_1146" id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a> "I shall have no rest," said a pensioner, "until I
have thrust my sword up to the hilt in the heart of this impious
wretch." Old commanders of troops, who were feared by
all on account of their unruly character; the satellites who
followed in their train; insolent young people, sons of the
first persons in the state, who thought everything was lawful
against miserable preachers, and their stupid flocks; priests
inflamed with hatred, and treading in the footsteps of these old
captains and giddy young men, who seemed to take the pulpit
of a church for the bench of a pot-house: all poured torrents
of insults on the Reform and its adherents. "The townspeople,"
exclaimed with one accord these drunken soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
and these fanatic priests, "are heretics, soul-stealers, conscience-slayers,
and Zwingle&mdash;that horrible man, who commits
infamous sins&mdash;is the <i>Lutheran God</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1147_1147" id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a></p>

<p>They went still further. Passing from words to deeds, the
Five Cantons persecuted the poor people among them who
loved the Word of God, flung them into prison, imposed fines
upon them, brutally tormented them, and mercilessly expelled
them from their country. The people of Schwytz did even
worse. Not fearing to announce their sinister designs, they
appeared at a Landsgemeinde wearing pine-branches in their
hats, in sign of war, and no one opposed them. "The Abbot
of St. Gall," said they, "is a prince of the Empire, and
holds his investiture from the Emperor. Do they imagine
that Charles V. will not avenge him?"&mdash;"Have not these
heretics," said others, "dared to form a <i>Christian Fraternity</i>,
as if old Switzerland was a heathen country?" Secret councils
were continually held in one place or another.<a name="FNanchor_1148_1148" id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a> New
alliances were sought with the Valais, the Pope, and the
Emperor<a name="FNanchor_1149_1149" id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a>&mdash;blamable alliances, no doubt, but such as they
might at least justify by the proverb: "Birds of a feather
go together;" which Zurich and Venice could not say.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOREBODINGS OF BERKS.</div>

<p>The Valaisans at first refused their support: they preferred
remaining neuter; but on a sudden their fanaticism
was inflamed. A sheet of paper was found on an altar&mdash;such
at least was the report circulated in their valleys,&mdash;in
which Zurich and Berne were accused of preaching that to
commit an offence against nature is a smaller crime than to
hear Mass!<a name="FNanchor_1150_1150" id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a> Who had placed this mysterious paper on the
altar? Came it from man? Did it fall from heaven?......They
knew not; but however that might be, it was
copied, circulated, and read everywhere; and the effects of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
this fable, invented by some villain, says Zwingle,<a name="FNanchor_1151_1151" id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a> was such
that Valais immediately granted the support it had at first
refused! The Waldstettes, proud of their strength, then
closed their ranks; their fierce eyes menaced the heretical
cantons; and the winds bore from their mountains to their
neighbours of the towns a formidable clang of arms.</p>

<p>At the sight of these alarming manifestations the evangelical
cities were in commotion. They first assembled at
Basle in February 1531, then at Zurich in March. "What
is to be done?" said the deputies from Zurich, after setting
forth their grievances; "how can we punish these infamous
calumnies, and force these threatening arms to fall?"&mdash;"We
understand," replied Berne "that you would have recourse
to violence; but think of these secret and formidable alliances
that are forming with the Pope, the Emperor, the King
of France, with so many princes, in a word with all the priests'
party, to accelerate our ruin;&mdash;think on the innocence of so
many pious souls in the Five Cantons, who deplore these perfidious
machinations;&mdash;think how easy it is to begin a war,
but that no one can tell when it will end."<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a> Sad foreboding!
which a catastrophe, beyond all human foresight, accomplished
but too soon. "Let us therefore send a deputation to
the Five Cantons," continued Berne; "let us call upon them
to punish these infamous calumnies in accordance with the
treaty; and if they refuse, let us break off all intercourse
with them."&mdash;"What will be the use of this mission?" asked
Basle. "Do we not know the brutality of this people? And
is it not to be feared that the rough treatment to which our
deputies will be exposed, may make the matter worse? Let
us rather convoke a general diet." Schaffhausen and St.
Gall having concurred in this opinion, Berne summoned a
diet at Baden for the 10th April, at which deputies from all
the cantons were assembled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MUTUAL ERRORS.</div>

<p>Many of the principal men among the Waldstettes disapproved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
of the violence of the retired soldiers and of the monks.
They saw that these continually repeated insults would injure
their cause. "The insults of which you complain," said
they to the diet, "afflict us no less than you. We shall
know how to punish them, and we have already done so.
But there are violent men on both sides. The other day a
man of Basle having met on the highroad a person who was
coming from Berne, and having learnt that he was going to
Lucerne:&mdash;'To go from Berne to Lucerne,' exclaimed he,
'is passing from a father to an arrant knave!'" The mediating
cantons invited the two parties to banish every cause of
discord.</p>

<p>But the war of the Chatelain of Musso having then broken
out, Zwingle and Zurich, who saw in it the first act of a
vast conspiracy, destined to stifle the Reform in every place,
called their allies together. "We must waver no longer,"
said Zwingle; "the rupture of the alliance on the part of
the Five Cantons, and the unheard of insults with which
they load us, impose upon us the obligation of marching
against our enemies,<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a> before the Emperor, who is still detained
by the Turks, shall have expelled the Landgrave,
seized upon Strasburg, and subjugated even ourselves."
All the blood of the ancient Swiss seemed to boil in this
man's veins; and while Uri, Schwytz, and Unterwalden
basely kissed the hand of Austria, this Zuricher&mdash;the greatest
Helvetian of the age&mdash;faithful to the memory of old
Switzerland, but not so to still holier traditions, followed in
the glorious steps of Stauffacher and Winkelried.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAILURE OF THE DIET.</div>

<p>The warlike tone of Zurich alarmed its confederates.
Basle proposed a summons, and then, in case of refusal, the
rupture of the alliance. Schaffhausen and St. Gall were
frightened even at this step: "The mountaineers, so proud,
indomitable, and exasperated," said they, "will accept with
joy the dissolution of the Confederation, and then shall we be
more advanced?" Such was the posture of affairs, when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
to the great astonishment of all, deputies from Uri and
Schywtz made their appearance. They were coldly received;
the cup of honour was not offered to them; and they
had to walk, according to their own account, in the midst of
the insulting cries of the people. They unsuccessfully
endeavoured to excuse their conduct. "We have long been
waiting," was the cold reply of the diet, "to see your actions
and your words agree."<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> The men of Schwytz and of
Uri returned in sadness to their homes; and the assembly
broke up, full of sorrow and distress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ACTIVITY OF ZURICH.</div>

<p>Zwingle beheld with pain the deputies of the evangelical
towns separating without having come to any decision. He
no longer desired only a reformation of the Church; he
wished for a transformation in the Confederacy; and it was
this latter reform that he now was preaching from the pulpit,
according to what we learn from Bullinger.<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a> He was not
the only person who desired it. For a long time the inhabitants
of the most populous and powerful towns of Switzerland
had complained that the Waldstettes, whose contingent
of men and money was much below theirs, had
an equal share in the deliberations of the diet and in the
fruits of their victories. This had been the cause of division
after the Burgundian War. The Five Cantons, by means
of their adherents, had the majority. Now Zwingle
thought that the reins of Switzerland should be placed in the
hands of the great cities, and, above all, in those of the
powerful cantons of Berne and Zurich. New times, in his
opinion, called for new forms. It was not sufficient to dismiss
from every public office the pensioners of foreign
princes, and substitute pious men in their place; the
federal compact must be remodelled, and settled upon a
more equitable basis. A national constituent assembly
would doubtless have responded to his wishes. These discourses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
which were rather those of a tribune of the people
than of a minister of Jesus Christ, hastened on the terrible
catastrophe.</p>

<p>And indeed the animated words of the patriot reformer
passed from the church where they had been delivered into
the councils and the halls of the guilds, into the streets and
the fields. The burning words that fell from the lips of this
man kindled the hearts of his fellow-citizens. The electric
spark, escaping with noise and commotion, was felt even
in the most distant cottage. The ancient traditions of
wisdom and prudence seemed forgotten. Public opinion declared
itself energetically. On the 29th and 30th April,
a number of horsemen rode hastily out of Zurich; they
were envoys from the council, commissioned to remind all the
allied cities of the encroachment of the Five Cantons, and
to call for a prompt and definitive decision. Reaching their
several destinations, the messengers recapitulated the grievances.<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a>
"Take care," said they in conclusion; "great
dangers are impending over all of us. The Emperor and
King Ferdinand are making vast preparations; they are
about to enter Switzerland with large sums of money, and
with a numerous army."</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIET OF ARAU.</div>

<p>Zurich joined actions to words. This state, being resolved
to make every exertion to establish the free preaching of the
Gospel in those bailiwicks where it shared the sovereignty
with the Roman-catholic cantons, desired to interfere by force
wherever negotiations could not prevail. The federal rights,
it must be confessed, were trampled under foot at St. Gall,
in Thurgovia, in the Rheinthal; and Zurich substituted arbitrary
decisions in their place, that excited the indignation of
the Waldstettes to the highest degree. Thus the number
of enemies to the Reform kept increasing; the tone of the
Five Cantons became daily more threatening, and the inhabitants
of the canton of Zurich, whom their business called into
the mountains, were loaded with insults, and sometimes badly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
treated. These violent proceedings excited in turn the anger
of the reformed cantons. Zwingle traversed Thurgovia, St.
Gall, and the Tockenburg, everywhere organizing synods,
taking part in their proceedings, and preaching before excited
and enthusiastic crowds. In all parts he met with confidence
and respect. At St. Gall an immense crowd assembled under
his windows, and a concert of voices and instruments
expressed to the reformer the public gratitude in harmonious
songs. "Let us not abandon ourselves," he repeated continually,
"and all will go well." It was resolved that a
meeting should be held at Arau on the 12th May, to deliberate
on a posture of affairs that daily became more critical.
This meeting was to be the beginning of sorrows.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>V. Zwingle's scheme with regard to the establishment of
a new Helvetian constitution did not prevail in the diet of
Arau. Perhaps it was thought better to see the result of the
crisis. Perhaps a more Christian, a more federal view&mdash;the
hope of procuring the unity of Switzerland by unity of
faith&mdash;occupied men's minds more than the pre-eminence of
the cities. In truth, if a certain number of cantons remained
with the Pope, the unity of the Confederation was destroyed,
it might be for ever. But if all the Confederation was brought
over to the same faith, the ancient Helvetic unity would be
established on the strongest and surest foundation. Now
was the time for acting&mdash;or never; and there must be no
fear of employing a violent remedy to restore the whole body
to health.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONTRARY OPINIONS.</div>

<p>Nevertheless, the allies shrunk back at the thought of
restoring religious liberty or political unity by means of
arms; and to escape from the difficulties in which the Confederation
was placed, they sought a middle course between
war and peace. "There is no doubt," said the deputies
from Berne, "that the behaviour of the cantons with regard
to the Word of God fully authorizes an armed intervention;
but the dangers that threaten us on the side of Italy and the
Empire&mdash;the danger of arousing the lion from his slumber&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
general want and misery that afflict our people&mdash;the rich
harvests that will soon cover our fields, and that the war
would infallibly destroy&mdash;the great number of pious men
among the Waldstettes, and whose innocent blood would
flow along with that of the guilty:&mdash;all these motives enjoin
us to leave the sword in the scabbard. Let us rather close
our markets against the Five Cantons; let us refuse them
corn, salt, wine, steel, and iron; we shall thus impart authority
to the friends of peace among them, and innocent blood
will be spared."<a name="FNanchor_1157_1157" id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a> The meeting separated forthwith to carry
this intermediate proposition to the different Evangelical cantons,
and on the 15th May again assembled at Zurich.</p>

<p>Convinced that the means apparently the most violent
were nevertheless both the surest and the most humane, Zurich
resisted the Bernese proposition with all its might.
"By accepting this proposition," said they, "we sacrifice
the advantages that we now possess, and we give the Five
Cantons time to arm themselves, and to fall upon us first.
Let us take care that the Emperor does not then attack us
on one side, while our ancient confederates attack us on the
other; a just war is not in opposition to the Word of God;
but this is contrary to it&mdash;taking the bread from the mouths
of the innocent as well as the guilty; straitening by hunger
the sick, the aged, pregnant women, children, and all
who are deeply afflicted by the injustice of the Waldstettes.<a name="FNanchor_1158_1158" id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a>
We should beware of exciting by this means the anger of the
poor, and transforming into enemies many who at the present
time are our friends and our brothers!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAULTS OF THE REFORMATION.</div>

<p>We must acknowledge that this language, which was Zwingle's,
contained much truth. But the other cantons, and
Berne in particular, were immoveable. "When we have
once shed the blood of our brothers," said they, "we shall
never be able to restore life to those who have lost it; while,
from the moment the Waldstettes have given us satisfaction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
we shall be able to put an end to all these severe measures.
We are resolved not to begin the war." There were no
means of running counter to such a declaration. The Zurichers
consented to refuse supplies to the Waldstettes; but
it was with hearts full of anguish, as if they had foreseen all
that this deplorable measure would cost them.<a name="FNanchor_1159_1159" id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a> It was
agreed that the severe step that was now about to be taken
should not be suspended except by common consent, and that,
as it would create great exasperation, each one should hold
himself prepared to repel the attacks of the enemy. Zurich
and Berne were commissioned to notify this determination to
the Five Cantons; and Zurich, discharging its task with promptitude,
immediately forwarded an order to every bailiwick to
suspend all communication with the Waldstettes, commanding
them at the same time to abstain from ill-usage and hostile
language. Thus the Reformation, becoming imprudently
mixed up with political combinations, marched from fault
to fault; it pretended to preach the Gospel to the poor, and
was now about to refuse them bread!</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE'S SERMON.</div>

<p>On the Sunday following&mdash;it was Whitsunday&mdash;the resolution
was published from the pulpits. Zwingle walked towards
his, where an immense crowd was waiting for him.
The piercing eye of this great man easily discovered the
dangers of the measure in a political point of view, and
his christian heart deeply felt all its cruelty. His soul was
overburdened, his eyes downcast. If at this moment the true
character of a minister of the Gospel had awoke within him;
if Zwingle with his powerful voice had called on the people
to humiliation before God, to forgiveness of trespasses, and
to prayer; safety might yet have dawned on "broken-hearted"
Switzerland. But it was not so. More and more the
Christian disappears in the Reformer, and the citizen alone
remains; but in that character he soars far above all, and his
policy is undoubtedly the most skilful. He sees clearly that
every delay may ruin Zurich; and after having made his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
through the people, and closed the book of the Prince of
Peace, he hesitates not to attack the resolution which he has
just communicated to the people, and on the very festival
of the Holy Ghost to preach war. "He who fears not to
call his adversary a criminal," says he in his usual forcible
language, "must be ready to follow the word with a blow.<a name="FNanchor_1160_1160" id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a>
If he does not strike, he will lie stricken. Men of Zurich!
you deny food to the Five Cantons, as to evil-doers: well! let
the blow follow the threat, rather than reduce poor innocent
creatures to starvation. If, by not taking the offensive, you
appear to believe that there is not sufficient reason for punishing
the Waldstettes, and yet you refuse them food and drink,
you will force them by this line of conduct to take up arms,
to raise their hands, and to inflict punishment upon you.
This is the fate that awaits you."</p>

<p>These words of the eloquent reformer moved the whole
assembly. Zwingle's politic mind already so influenced and
misled all the people that there were few souls christian enough
to feel how strange it was that on the very day when they
were celebrating the outpouring of the Spirit of peace and
love upon the Christian Church, the mouth of a minister of
God should utter a provocation to war. They looked at this
sermon only in a political point of view: "It is a seditious
discourse; it is an excitement to civil war!" said some. "No,"
replied others, "it is the language that the safety of the
state requires!" All Zurich was agitated. "Zurich has too
much fire," said Berne. "Berne has too much cunning,"
replied Zurich.<a name="FNanchor_1161_1161" id="FNanchor_1161_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a> Zwingle's gloomy prophecy was too soon to
be fulfilled!</p>

<div class="sidenote">BLOCKADE OF THE WALDSTETTES.</div>

<p>No sooner had the reformed cantons communicated to the
Waldstettes this pitiless decree than they hastened its execution;
and Zurich showed the greatest strictness respecting
it. Not only the markets of Zurich and of Berne, but also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
those of the free bailiwicks, those of St. Gall, of the Tockenburg,
of the district of Sargans and of the valley of the Rhine,
a country partly under the sovereignty of the Waldstettes,
were shut against the Five Cantons. A formidable power
had suddenly encompassed with barrenness, famine, and
death, the noble founders of Helvetian liberty. Uri, Schwytz,
Unterwalden, Zug, and Lucerne, were, as it seemed, in the
midst of a vast desert. Their own subjects, thought they at
least, the communes that have taken the oath of allegiance
to them, would range themselves on their side! But no; Bremgarten,
and even Mellingen, refused all succour. Their last
hope was in Wesen and the Gastal. Neither Berne nor Zurich
have anything to do there; Schwytz and Glaris alone
rule over them; but the power of their enemies has penetrated
everywhere. A majority of thirteen votes had declared in
favour of Zurich at the Landsgemeinde of Glaris; and Glaris
closed the gates of Wesen and of the Gastal against Schwytz.
In vain did Berne itself cry out: "How can you compel subjects
to refuse supplies to their lords?" In vain did Schwytz
raise its voice in indignation; Zurich immediately sent to Wesen&mdash;&mdash;gunpowder
and bullets. It is upon Zurich, therefore,
that falls all the odium of a measure which that city had
at first so earnestly combated. At Arau, at Bremgarten, at
Mellingen, in the free bailiwicks, were several carriages
laden with provisions for the Waldstettes. They were stopped,
unloaded, and upset: with them were barricades erected on
the roads leading to Lucerne, Schwytz, and Zug. Already a
year of dearth had made provisions scarce in the Five Cantons;&mdash;already
had a frightful epidemic, the <i>Sweating Sickness</i>,
scattered everywhere despondency and death: but now
the hand of man was joined to the hand of God; the evil increased,
and the poor inhabitants of these mountains beheld
unheard-of calamities approach with hasty steps. No more
bread for their children&mdash;no more wine to revive their exhausted
strength&mdash;no more salt for their flocks and herds!
Everything failed them that man requires for subsistence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_1162_1162" id="FNanchor_1162_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a>
One could not see such things, and be a man, without a broken
heart. In the confederate cities, and out of Switzerland, numerous
voices were raised against this implacable measure.
What good can result from it? Did not St. Paul write to
the Romans: "If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst,
give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire
on his head?"<a name="FNanchor_1163_1163" id="FNanchor_1163_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a> And when the magistrates wished to convince
certain refractory communes of the utility of the measure:
"We desire no religious war," cried they. "If the
Waldstettes will not believe in God, let them stick to the
devil!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">INDIGNATION.</div>

<div class="sidenote">BLOCKADE.</div>

<p>But it was especially in the Five Cantons that earnest complaints
were heard. The most pacific individuals, and even
the secret partisans of the Reform, seeing famine invade
their habitations, felt the deepest indignation. The enemies
of Zurich skilfully took advantage of this disposition; they
fostered these murmurs; and soon the cry of anger and
distress re-echoed from all the mountains. In vain did Berne
represent to the Waldstettes that it is more cruel to refuse men
the nourishment of the soul than to cut off that of the body.
"God," replied these mountaineers in their despair, "God
causes the fruits of the earth to grow freely for all men!"<a name="FNanchor_1164_1164" id="FNanchor_1164_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a>
They were not content with groaning in their cottages, and
venting their indignation in councils; they filled all Switzerland
with complaints and menaces.<a name="FNanchor_1165_1165" id="FNanchor_1165_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a> "They wish to employ
famine to tear us from our ancient faith; they wish to deprive
our wives and our children of bread, that they may take
from us the liberty we derive from our forefathers. When
did such things ever take place in the bosom of the Confederation?
Did we not see, in the last war, the Confederates
with arms in their hands, and who were ready to draw the
sword, eating together from the same dish? They tear in
pieces old friendships&mdash;they trample our ancient manners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
underfoot&mdash;they violate treaties&mdash;they break alliances......We
invoke the charters of our ancestor. Help! help!......Wise
men of our people, give us your advice, and all you
who know how to handle the sling and the sword, come and
maintain with us the sacred possessions, for which our
fathers, delivered from the yoke of the stranger, united their
arms and their hearts."</p>


<p>At the same time the Five Cantons sent into Alsace,
Brisgau, and Swabia to obtain salt, wine, and bread; but the
administration of the cities was implacable; the orders were
everywhere given and everywhere strictly executed. Zurich
and the other allied cantons intercepted all communication,
and sent back to Germany the supplies that had been
forwarded to their brethren. These Five Cantons were like a
vast fortress, all the issues from which are closely guarded
by watchful sentinels. The afflicted Waldstettes, on beholding
themselves alone with famine between their lakes and
their mountains, had recourse to the observances of their worship.
All sports, dances, and every kind of amusement were
interdicted;<a name="FNanchor_1166_1166" id="FNanchor_1166_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a> prayers were directed to be offered up; and
long processions covered the roads of Einsideln and other
resorts of pilgrims. They assumed the belt, and staff, and
arms of the brotherhood to which they each belonged; each
man carried a chaplet in his hands, and repeated paternosters;
the mountains and the valleys re-echoed with their
plaintive hymns. But the Waldstettes did still more: they
grasped their swords&mdash;they sharpened the points of their halberds&mdash;they
brandished their weapons in the direction of
Zurich and of Berne, and exclaimed with rage: "They
block up their roads, but we will open them with our right
arms!"<a name="FNanchor_1167_1167" id="FNanchor_1167_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a> No one replied to this cry of despair; but there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
a just Judge in heaven to whom vengeance belongs, and who
will soon reply in a terrible manner, by punishing those misguided
persons, who, forgetful of Christian mercy, and making
an impious mixture of political and religious matters, pretend
to secure the triumph of the Gospel by famine and by
armed men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRANCE CONCILIATES.</div>

<p>Some attempts, however, were made to arrange matters;
but these very efforts proved a great humiliation for Switzerland
and for the Reform. It was not the ministers of the Gospel,
it was France&mdash;more than once an occasion of discord to
Switzerland&mdash;that offered to restore peace. Every proceeding
calculated to increase its influence among the cantons was
of service to its policy. On the 14th May, Maigret and
Dangertin (the latter of whom had received the Gospel truth,
and consequently did not dare return to France),<a name="FNanchor_1168_1168" id="FNanchor_1168_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> after some
allusions to the spirit which Zurich had shown in this affair&mdash;a
spirit little in accordance with the Gospel&mdash;said to the
council: "The king our master has sent you two gentlemen
to consult on the means of preserving concord among you. If
war and tumult invade Switzerland, all the society of the
Helvetians will be destroyed,<a name="FNanchor_1169_1169" id="FNanchor_1169_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a> and whichever party is the
conqueror, he will be as much ruined as the other." Zurich
having replied that if the Five Cantons would allow the free
preaching of the Word of God, the reconciliation would be
easy, the French secretly sounded the Waldstettes, whose
answer was: "We will never permit the preaching of the
Word of God, as the people of Zurich understand it."<a name="FNanchor_1170_1170" id="FNanchor_1170_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FIVE CANTONS INFLEXIBLE.</div>

<p>These more or less interested exertions of the foreigners
having failed, a general diet became the only chance of
safety that remained for Switzerland. One was accordingly
convoked at Bremgarten. It was opened in presence of
deputies from France, from the Duke of Milan, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
Countess of Neuchatel, from the Grisons, Valais, Thurgovia,
and the district of Sargans; and met on five different occasions,&mdash;on
the 14th and 20th June, on the 9th July, and the
10th and 23d August. The chronicler Bullinger, who was
pastor of Bremgarten, delivered an oration at the opening,
in which he earnestly exhorted the Confederates to union
and peace.</p>

<p>A gleam of hope for a moment cheered Switzerland. The
blockade had become less strict; friendship and good neighbourhood
had prevailed in many places over the decrees of
the state. Unusual roads had been opened across the wildest
mountains to convey supplies to the Waldstettes. Provisions
were concealed in bales of merchandise; and while Lucerne
imprisoned and tortured its own citizens, who were found
with the books of the Zurichers,<a name="FNanchor_1171_1171" id="FNanchor_1171_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> Berne punished but slightly
the peasants who had been discovered bearing food for Unterwalden
and Lucerne; and Glaris shut its eyes on the frequent
violation of its orders. The voice of charity, that
had been momentarily stifled, pleaded with fresh energy the
cause of their confederates before the reformed cantons.</p>

<p>But the Five Cantons were inflexible. "We will not
listen to any proposition before the raising of the blockade,"
said they. "We will not raise it," replied Berne and Zurich,
"before the Gospel is allowed to be freely preached,
not only in the common bailiwicks, but also in the Five Cantons."
This was undoubtedly going too far, even according
to the natural law and the principles of the Confederation.
The councils of Zurich might consider it their duty to have
recourse to war for maintaining liberty of conscience in the
common bailiwicks; but it was unjust&mdash;it was a usurpation,
to constrain the Five Cantons in a matter that concerned their
own territory. Nevertheless the mediators succeeded, not
without much trouble, in drawing up a plan of conciliation
that seemed to harmonize with the wishes of both parties.
The conference was broken up, and this project was hastily
transmitted to the different states for their ratification.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZURICH.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>The diet met again a few days after; but the Five Cantons
persisted in their demand, without yielding in any one
point. In vain did Zurich and Berne represent to them,
that, by persecuting the Reformed, the cantons violated the
treaty of peace; in vain did the mediators exhaust their
strength in warnings and entreaties. The parties appeared at
one time to approximate, and then on a sudden they were
more distant and more irritated than ever. The Waldstettes
at last brake up the third conference by declaring, that far
from opposing the Evangelical truth, they would maintain it,
as it had been taught by the Redeemer, by his holy Apostles,
by the Four Doctors, and by their holy mother, the Church&mdash;a
declaration that seemed a bitter irony to the deputies from
Zurich and Berne. Nevertheless Berne, turning towards
Zurich as they were separating, observed: "Beware of too
much violence, even should they attack you!"</p>

<p>This exhortation was unnecessary. The strength of Zurich
had passed away. The first appearance of the Reformation
and of the Reformers had been greeted with joy. The people,
who groaned under a twofold slavery, believed they
saw the dawn of liberty. But their minds, abandoned for ages
to superstition and ignorance, being unable immediately to
realize the hopes they had conceived, a spirit of discontent
soon spread among the masses. The change by which
Zwingle, ceasing to be a man of the Gospel, became the
man of the State, took away from the people the enthusiasm
necessary to resist the terrible attacks they would
have to sustain. The enemies of the Reform had a fair
chance against it, so soon as its friends abandoned the position
that gave them strength. Besides, Christians could not
have recourse to famine and to war to secure the triumph
of the Gospel, without their consciences becoming troubled.
The Zurichers "<i>walked not in the Spirit, but in the flesh;
now, the works of the flesh are hatred, variance, emulations,
wrath, strife, seditions</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1172_1172" id="FNanchor_1172_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> The danger without was increasing,
while within, hope, agreement, and courage were far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
from being augmented: men saw on the contrary the gradual
disappearance of that harmony and lively faith which had been
the strength of the Reform. The Reformation had grasped
the sword, and that very sword pierced its heart.</p>

<p>Occasions of discord were multiplied in Zurich. By the
advice of Zwingle, the number of nobles was diminished in
the two councils, because of their opposition to the Gospel;
and this measure spread discontent among the most honourable
families of the canton. The millers and bakers
were placed under certain regulations, which the dearth
rendered necessary, and a great part of the townspeople attributed
this proceeding to the sermons of the Reformer, and
became irritated against him. Rodolph Lavater, bailiff of
Kibourg, was appointed captain-general, and the officers
who were of longer standing than he were offended. Many
who had been formerly the most distinguished by their zeal
for the Reform, now openly opposed the cause they had
supported. The ardour with which the ministers of peace
demanded war, spread in every quarter a smothered dissatisfaction,
and many persons gave vent to their indignation.
This unnatural confusion of Church and State which had
corrupted Christianity after the age of Constantine, was hurrying
on the ruin of the Reformation. The majority of the
Great Council, ever ready to adopt important and salutary
resolutions, was abolished. The old magistrates, who were
still at the head of affairs, allowed themselves to be carried
away by feelings of jealousy against men whose non-official
influence prevailed over theirs. All those who hated the doctrine
of the Gospel, whether from love of the world or from
love to the Pope, boldly raised their heads in Zurich. The
partisans of the monks, the friends of foreign service, the
malcontents of every class, coalesced in pointing out Zwingle
as the author of all the sufferings of the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE'S FALSE POSITION.</div>

<p>Zwingle was heart-broken. He saw that Zurich and the
Reformation were hastening to their ruin, and he could not
check them. How could he do so, since, without suspecting
it, he had been the principal accomplice in these disasters?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
What was to be done? Shall the pilot remain in the ship
which he is no longer permitted to save? There was but
one means of safety for Zurich and for Zwingle. He should
have retired from the political stage, and fallen back on
that <i>kingdom which is not of this world</i>; he should, like
Moses, have kept his hands and his heart night and day
raised towards heaven, and energetically preached repentance,
faith, and peace. But religious and political matters
were united in the mind of this great man by such old and
dear ties, that it was impossible for him to distinguish their
line of separation. This confusion had become his dominant
idea; the Christian and the citizen were for him one
and the same character; and hence it resulted, that all resources
of the state&mdash;even cannons and arquebuses&mdash;were
to be placed at the service of the Truth. When one peculiar
idea thus seizes upon a man, we see a false conscience
formed within him, which approves of many things condemned
by the Word of God.</p>

<p>This was now Zwingle's condition. War appeared to
him legitimate and desirable; and if that was refused, he
had only to withdraw from public life: he was for everything
or nothing. He therefore, on the 26th July, appeared
before the Great Council, with dimmed eyes and disconsolate
heart: "It is now eleven years," said he, "since I have been
preaching the Gospel among you, and that I have warned
you faithfully and paternally of the woes that are hanging
over you; but no attention is paid to my words; the friends
of foreign alliances, the enemies of the Gospel, are elected
to the council, and while you refuse to follow my advice,
I am made responsible for every misfortune. I cannot accept
such a position, and I ask for my dismissal." The
reformer retired bathed in tears.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GREAT COUNCIL.</div>

<p>The council shuddered as they heard these words. All
the old feelings of respect which they had so long entertained
for Zwingle were revived; to lose him now was to ruin
Zurich. The burgomaster and the other magistrates received
orders to persuade him to recall his fatal resolution. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
conference took place on the same day; Zwingle asked time
for consideration. For three days and three nights he sought
the road that he should follow. Seeing the dark storm that
was collecting from all quarters, he considered whether he
ought to quit Zurich and seek refuge on the lofty hills of
the Tockenburg, where he had been reared, when his country
and his Church were on the point of being assailed and
beaten down by their enemies, like corn by the hailstorm.
He groaned and cried to the Lord. He would have put away
the cup of bitterness that was presented to his soul, but could
not gather up the resolution. At length the sacrifice was
accomplished, and the victim was placed shuddering upon the
altar. Three days after the first conference, Zwingle reappeared
in the council: "I will stay with you," said he,
"and I will labour for the public safety&mdash;until death!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE AT BREMGARTEN.</div>

<p>From this moment he displayed new zeal. On the one
hand, he endeavoured to revive harmony and courage in
Zurich; on the other, he set about arousing and exciting the
allied cities to increase and concentrate all the forces of the
Reformation. Faithful to the political character he imagined
he had received from God himself&mdash;persuaded that it was
in the doubts and want of energy of the Bernese that he
must look for the cause of all the evil, the Reformer repaired
to Bremgarten with Collin and Steiner, during the fourth
conference of the diet, although he incurred great danger in
the attempt. He arrived secretly by night, and having entered
the house of his friend and disciple, Bullinger, he invited
the deputies of Berne (J. J. de Watteville and Jur Hag) to
meet him there with the greatest secrecy, and prayed them
in the most solemn tone earnestly to reflect upon the dangers
of the Reform. "I fear," said he, "that in consequence of
our unbelief, this business will not succeed. By refusing supplies
to the Five Cantons, we have begun a work that will be
fatal to us. What is to be done? Withdraw the prohibition?
The cantons will then be more insolent and haughty
than ever. Enforce it? They will take the offensive, and if
their attack succeed, you will behold our fields red with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
blood of the believers, the doctrine of truth cast down, the
Church of Christ laid waste, all social relations overthrown,
our adversaries more hardened and irritated against the Gospel,
and crowds of priests and monks again fill our rural districts,
streets, and temples......And yet," added Zwingle,
after a few instants of emotion and silence, "that also will
have an end." The Bernese were filled with agitation by
the solemn voice of the reformer. "We see," replied
they, "all that is to be feared for our common cause, and we
will employ every care to prevent such great disasters."&mdash;"I
who write these things was present and heard them," adds
Bullinger.<a name="FNanchor_1173_1173" id="FNanchor_1173_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE APPARITION.</div>

<p>It was feared that if the presence of Zwingle at Bremgarten
became known to the deputies of the Five Cantons,
they would not restrain their violence. During this nocturnal
conference three of the town councillors were stationed
as sentinels in front of Bullinger's house. Before daybreak,
the reformer and his two friends, accompanied by
Bullinger and the three councillors, passed through the deserted
streets leading to the gate on the road to Zurich.
Three different times Zwingle took leave of Bullinger, who
was erelong to be his successor. His mind was filled with
a presentiment of his approaching death; he could not tear
himself from that young friend whose face he was never to
see again; he blessed him amidst floods of tears. "O my
dear Henry!" said he, "may God protect you! Be faithful
to our Lord Jesus Christ, and to his Church!" At
length they separated; but at that very moment, says Bullinger,
a mysterious personage, clad in a robe as white
as snow, suddenly appeared, and after frightening the soldiers
who guarded the gate, plunged suddenly into the water, and
vanished. Bullinger, Zwingle, and their friends did not perceive
it; Bullinger himself sought for it all around, but to
no purpose;<a name="FNanchor_1174_1174" id="FNanchor_1174_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a> still the sentinels persisted in the reality of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
frightful apparition. Bullinger in great agitation returned in
darkness and in silence to his house. His mind involuntarily
compared the departure of Zwingle and the white phantom;
and he shuddered at the frightful omen which the
thought of this spectre impressed upon his mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRIGHTFUL OMENS.</div>

<p>Sufferings of another kind pursued Zwingle to Zurich.
He had thought that by consenting to remain at the head of
affairs, he would recover all his ancient influence. But he
was deceived: the people desired to see him there, and yet
they would not follow him. The Zurichers daily became
more and more indisposed towards the war which they had at
first demanded, and identified themselves with the passive
system of Berne. Zwingle remained for some time stupefied
and motionless before this inert mass, which his most vigorous
exertions could not move. But soon discovering in every quarter
of the horizon the prophetic signs, precursors of the storm
about to burst upon the ship of which he was the pilot, he
uttered cries of anguish, and showed the signal of distress.
"I see," exclaimed he one day to the people from the pulpit,
whither he had gone to give utterance to his gloomy forebodings,&mdash;"I
see that the most faithful warnings cannot save you:
you will not punish the pensioners of the foreigner......They
have too firm a support among us! A chain is prepared&mdash;behold
it entire&mdash;it unrolls link after link,&mdash;soon they
will bind me to it, and more than one pious Zuricher with
me......It is against me they are enraged! I am ready;
I submit to the Lord's will. But these people shall never be
my masters......As for thee, O Zurich, they will give thee
thy reward; they will strike thee on the head. Thou willest
it. Thou refusest to punish them; well! it is they who will
punish thee.<a name="FNanchor_1175_1175" id="FNanchor_1175_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a> But God will not the less preserve his Word,
and their haughtiness shall come to an end." Such was Zwingle's
cry of agony; but the immobility of death alone replied.
The hearts of the Zurichers were so hardened that the sharpest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
arrows of the reformer could not pierce them, and they fell at
his feet blunted and useless.</p>

<p>But events were pressing on, and justified all his fears.
The Five Cantons had rejected every proposition that had
been made to them. "Why do you talk of punishing a few
wrongs?" they had replied to the mediators; "it is a question
of quite another kind. Do you not require that we
should receive back among us the heretics whom we have
banished, and tolerate no other priests than those who
preach conformably to the Word of God? We know what
that means. No&mdash;no&mdash;we will not abandon the religion of
our fathers; and if we must see our wives and our children
deprived of food, our hands will know how to conquer
what is refused to us: to that we pledge our bodies&mdash;our
goods&mdash;our lives." It was with this threatening language
that the deputies quitted the Diet of Bremgarten. They had
proudly shaken the folds of their mantles, war had fallen
from them.</p>

<p>The terror was general, and the alarmed citizens beheld
everywhere frightful portents, terrific signs, apparently foreboding
the most horrible events. It was not only the white
phantom that had appeared at Bremgarten at Zwingle's side:
the most fearful omens, passing from mouth to mouth, filled
the people with the most gloomy presentiments. The history
of these phenomena, however strange it may appear,
characterizes the period of which we write.</p>

<p>On the 26th July, a widow chancing to be alone before
her house in the village of Castelenschloss, suddenly beheld
a frightful spectacle&mdash;blood springing from the earth all
around her!<a name="FNanchor_1176_1176" id="FNanchor_1176_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a> She rushed in alarm into the cottage......but,
oh horrible! blood is flowing everywhere&mdash;from the
wainscot and from the stones;<a name="FNanchor_1177_1177" id="FNanchor_1177_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a>&mdash;it falls in a stream from a
basin on a shelf, and even the child's cradle overflows with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
it. The woman imagines that the invisible hand of an
assassin has been at work, and rushes in distraction out of
doors, crying murder! murder!<a name="FNanchor_1178_1178" id="FNanchor_1178_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a> The villagers and the
monks of a neighbouring convent assemble at the cry&mdash;they
succeed in partly effacing the bloody stains; but a little later
in the day, the other inhabitants of the house, sitting down
in terror to eat their evening meal under the projecting
eaves, suddenly discover blood bubbling up in a pond&mdash;blood
flowing from the loft&mdash;blood covering all the walls of the
house. Blood&mdash;blood&mdash;everywhere blood! The bailiff of
Schenkenberg and the pastor of Dalheim arrive&mdash;inquire into
the matter&mdash;and immediately report it to the lords of Berne
and to Zwingle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE COMET.</div>

<p>Scarcely had this horrible recital&mdash;the particulars of
which are faithfully preserved in Latin and in German&mdash;filled
all minds with the idea of a horrible butchery, than in
the western quarter of the heavens there appeared a frightful
comet,<a name="FNanchor_1179_1179" id="FNanchor_1179_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> whose immense train of a pale yellow colour
turned towards the south. At the time of its setting, this
apparition shone in the sky like the fire of a furnace.<a name="FNanchor_1180_1180" id="FNanchor_1180_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a>
One night&mdash;on the 15th August as it would appear<a name="FNanchor_1181_1181" id="FNanchor_1181_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a>&mdash;Zwingle
and George Mühler, formerly abbot of Wettingen, being
together in the cemetery of the cathedral, both fixed their
eyes upon this terrific meteor. "This ominous globe," said
Zwingle, "is come to light the path that leads to my grave.
It will be at the cost of my life and of many good men with
me. Although I am rather shortsighted, I foresee great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
calamities in the future.<a name="FNanchor_1182_1182" id="FNanchor_1182_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a> The Truth and the Church will
mourn; but Christ will never abandon us." It was not
only at Zurich that this flaming star spread consternation.
Vadianus being one night on an eminence in the neighbourhood
of St. Gall, surrounded by his friends and disciples,
after having explained to them the names of the stars and
the miracles of the Creator, stopped before this comet, which
denounced the anger of God; and the famous Theophrastus
declared that it foreboded not only great bloodshed, but
most especially the death of learned and illustrious men.
This mysterious phenomenon prolonged its frightful visitation
until the 3d September.</p>

<p>When once the noise of these omens was spread abroad,
men could no longer contain themselves. Their imaginations
were excited; they heaped fright upon fright: each place
had its terrors. Two banners waving in the clouds had been
seen on the mountain of the Brunig; at Zug a buckler had
appeared in the heavens; on the banks of the Reuss, reiterated
explosions were heard during the night; on the lake
of the Four Cantons, ships carrying aërial combatants cruised
about in every direction. War&mdash;war;&mdash;blood&mdash;blood!&mdash;these
were the general cries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NEW MEDIATIONS.</div>

<p>In the midst of all this agitation, Zwingle alone seemed
tranquil. He rejected none of these presentiments, but he
contemplated them with calmness. "A heart that fears God,"
said he, "cares not for the threats of the world. To forward
the designs of God, whatever may happen,&mdash;this is his task.
A carrier who has a long road to go must make up his mind
to wear his waggon and his gear during the journey. If he
carry his merchandise to the appointed spot, that is enough
for him. We are the waggon and the gear of God. There
is not one of the articles that is not worn, twisted, or broken;
but our great Driver will not the less accomplish by our means
his vast designs. Is it not to those who fall upon the field of
battle that the noblest crown belongs? Take courage, then,
in the midst of all these dangers, through which the cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
of Jesus Christ must pass. Be of good cheer! although we
should never here below see its triumphs with our own eyes.
The Judge of the combat beholds us, and it is he who confers
the crown. Others will enjoy upon earth the fruits of our
labours; while we, already in heaven, shall enjoy an eternal
reward."<a name="FNanchor_1183_1183" id="FNanchor_1183_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a></p>

<p>Thus spoke Zwingle, as he advanced calmly towards the
threatening noise of the tempest, which, by its repeated
flashes and sudden explosions, foreboded death.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>VI. The Five Cantons, assembled in diet at Lucerne,
appeared full of determination, and war was decided upon.
"We will call upon the cities to respect our alliances," said
they, "and if they refuse, we will enter the common bailiwicks
by force to procure provisions, and we will unite our
banners in Zug to attack the enemy." The Waldstettes
were not alone. The Nuncio, being solicited by his Lucerne
friends, had required that auxiliary troops, paid by the Pope,
should be put in motion towards Switzerland, and he announced
their near arrival.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DECEITFUL CALM.</div>

<p>These resolutions carried terror into Switzerland; the
mediating cantons met again at Arau, and drew up a plan
that should leave the religious question just as it had been
settled by the treaty of 1529. Deputies immediately bore
these propositions to the different councils. Lucerne haughtily
rejected them. "Tell those who sent you," was the reply,
"that we do not acknowledge them as our schoolmasters.
We would rather die than yield the least thing to the prejudice
of our faith." The mediators returned to Arau, trembling
and discouraged. This useless attempt increased the
disagreement among the Reformed, and gave the Waldstettes
still greater confidence. Zurich, so decided for the
reception of the Gospel, now became daily more irresolute!
The members of the council distrusted each other;
the people felt no interest in this war; and Zwingle, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
his unshaken faith in the justice of his cause, had no
hope for the struggle that was about to take place. Berne,
on its side, did not cease to entreat Zurich to avoid precipitation.
"Do not let us expose ourselves to the reproach of
too much haste, as in 1529," was the general remark in
Zurich. "We have sure friends in the midst of the Waldstettes;
let us wait until they announce to us, as they have
promised, some real danger."</p>

<p>It was soon believed that these temporizers were right.
In fact the alarming news ceased. That constant rumour of
war, which incessantly came from the Waldstettes, discontinued.
There were no more alarms&mdash;no more fears! Deceitful
omen! Over the mountains and valleys of Switzerland
hangs that gloomy and mysterious silence, the forerunner of
the tempest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZURICH FOREWARNED.</div>

<p>Whilst they were sleeping at Zurich, the Waldstettes
were preparing to conquer their rights by force of arms.
The chiefs, closely united to each other by common interests
and dangers, found a powerful support in the indignation of the
people. In a diet of the Five Cantons, held at Brunnen on
the banks of the Lake of Lucerne, opposite Grutli, the alliances
of the Confederation were read; and the deputies, having
been summoned to declare by their votes whether they
thought the war just and lawful, all hands were raised with
a shudder. Immediately the Waldstettes had prepared their
attack with the profoundest mystery. All the passes had been
guarded&mdash;all communication between Zurich and the Five
Cantons had been rendered impossible. The friends upon
whom the Zurichers had reckoned on the banks of the Lakes
Lucerne and Zug, and who had promised them intelligence,
were like prisoners in their mountains. The terrible avalanche
was about to slip from the icy summits of the mountain,
and to roll into the valleys, even to the gates of Zurich,
overthrowing everything in its passage, without the least forewarning
of its fall. The mediators had returned discouraged
to their cantons. A spirit of imprudence and of error&mdash;sad
forerunner of the fall of republics as well as of kings&mdash;had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
spread over the whole city of Zurich. The council had at
first given the order to call out the militia; then, deceived
by the silence of the Waldstettes, it had imprudently revoked
the decree, and Lavater, the commander of the army, had
retired in discontent to Rybourg, and indignantly thrown far
from him that sword which they had commanded him to
leave in the scabbard. Thus the winds were about to be
unchained from the mountains; the waters of the great deep,
aroused by a terrible earthquake, were about to open; and
yet the vessel of the state, sadly abandoned, sported up and
down with indifference over the frightful gulf,&mdash;its yards
struck, its sails loose and motionless&mdash;without compass or
crew&mdash;without pilot, watch, or helm.</p>

<p>Whatever were the exertions of the Waldstettes, they
could not entirely stifle the rumour of war, which from
chalet to chalet called all their citizens to arms. God permits
a cry of alarm&mdash;a single one, it is true&mdash;to resound in
the ears of the people of Zurich. On the 4th October, a
little boy, who knew not what he was doing, succeeded in
crossing the frontier of Zug, and presented himself with two
loaves at the gate of the reformed monastery of Cappel, situated
in the farthest limits of the canton of Zurich. He was
led to the abbot, to whom the child gave the loaves without
saying a word. The superior, with whom there chanced
to be at this time a councillor from Zurich, Henry Peyer,
sent by his government, turned pale at the sight. "If the
Five Cantons intend entering by force of arms into the free
bailiwicks," had said these two Zurichers to one of their
friends in Zug, "you will send your son to us with one loaf;
but you will give him two if they are marching at once upon
the bailiwicks and upon Zurich." The abbot and the councillor
wrote with all speed to Zurich. "Be upon your
guard! take up arms," said they; but no credit was attached
to this information. The council were at that time occupied
in taking measures to prevent the supplies that had arrived
from Alsace from entering the cantons. Zwingle himself,
who had never ceased to announce war, did not believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
it. "These pensioners are really clever fellows," said the
reformer. "Their preparations may be after all nothing
but a French man&oelig;uvre."<a name="FNanchor_1184_1184" id="FNanchor_1184_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a></p>

<p>He was deceived&mdash;they were a reality. Four days were to
accomplish the ruin of Zurich. Let us retrace in succession
the history of these disastrous moments.</p>

<p>On Sunday, 8th October, a messenger appeared at Zurich,
and demanded, in the name of the Five Cantons, letters of
perpetual alliance.<a name="FNanchor_1185_1185" id="FNanchor_1185_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a> The majority saw in this step nothing
but a trick; but Zwingle began to discern the thunderbolt in
the black cloud that was drawing near. He was in the pulpit:
it was the last time he was destined to appear in it; and
as if he had seen a formidable spectre of Rome rise frightfully
above the Alps, calling upon him and upon his people
to abandon the faith:&mdash;"No, no!" cried he, "never will I
deny my Redeemer!"</p>

<p>At the same moment a messenger arrived in haste from
Mulinen, commander of the Knights-hospitallers of St. John at
Hitzkylch. "On Friday, 6th October," said he to the councils
of Zurich, "the people of Lucerne planted their banner
in the Great Square.<a name="FNanchor_1186_1186" id="FNanchor_1186_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a> Two men that I sent to Lucerne have
been thrown into prison. To-morrow morning, Monday,
9th October, the Five Cantons will enter the bailiwicks.
Already the country-people, frightened and fugitive, are running
to us in crowds."&mdash;"It is an idle story," said the councils.<a name="FNanchor_1187_1187" id="FNanchor_1187_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a>
Nevertheless they recalled the commander-in-chief
Lavater, who sent off a trusty man, nephew of James Winckler,
with orders to repair to Cappel, and if possible as far as
Zug, to reconnoitre the arrangements of the cantons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MANIFESTO OF THE CANTONS.</div>

<p>The Waldstettes were in reality assembling round the
banner of Lucerne. The people of this canton; the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
of Schwytz, Uri, Zug, and Unterwalden; refugees from
Zurich and Berne, with a few Italians, formed the main body
of the army, which had been raised to invade the free bailiwicks.
Two manifestoes were published&mdash;one addressed
to the cantons, the other to foreign princes and nations.</p>

<p>The Five Cantons energetically set forth the attacks made
upon the treaties, the discord sown throughout the Confederation,
and finally the refusal to sell them provisions&mdash;a
refusal whose only aim was (according to them) to excite
the people against the magistrates, and to establish the Reform
by force. "It is not true," added they, "that&mdash;as they
cease not to cry out&mdash;we oppose the preaching of the truth
and the reading of the Bible. As obedient members of the
Church, we desire to receive all that our holy mother receives.
But we reject all the books and the innovations of Zwingle
and his companions."<a name="FNanchor_1188_1188" id="FNanchor_1188_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a></p>

<p>Hardly had the messengers charged with these manifestoes
departed before the first division of the army began to march,
and arrived in the evening in the free bailiwicks. The soldiers
having entered the deserted churches, and having seen
the images of the saints removed and the altars broken, their
anger was kindled; they spread like a torrent over the whole
country, pillaged everything they met with, and were particularly
enraged against the houses of the pastors, where
they destroyed the furniture with oaths and maledictions.
At the same time the division that was to form the main army
marched upon Zug, thence to move upon Zurich.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INFATUATION OF ZURICH.</div>

<p>Cappel, at three leagues from Zurich, and about a league
from Zug, was the first place they would reach in the Zurich
territory, after crossing the frontier of the Five Cantons.
Near the Albis, between two hills of similar height, the
Granges on the north, and the Ifelsberg on the south, in the
midst of delightful pastures, stood the ancient and wealthy
convent of the Cistertians, in whose church were the tombs
of many ancient and noble families of these districts. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
Abbot Wolfgang Joner, a just and pious man, a great friend
of the arts and letters, and a distinguished preacher, had reformed
his convent in 1527. Full of compassion, rich in
good works, particularly towards the poor of the canton of
Zug and the free bailiwicks, he was held in great honour
throughout the whole country.<a name="FNanchor_1189_1189" id="FNanchor_1189_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> He predicted what would
be the termination of the war; yet as soon as danger approached,
he spared no labour to serve his country.</p>

<p>It was on Sunday night that the abbot received positive intelligence
of the preparations at Zug. He paced up and down
his cell with hasty steps; sleep fled from his eyes; he drew
near his lamp, and addressing his intimate friend, Peter Simmler,
who succeeded him, and who was then residing at Kylchberg,
a village on the borders of the lake, and about a league
from the town, he hastily wrote these words: "The great
anxiety and trouble which agitate me prevent me from busying
myself with the management of the house, and induce
me to write to you all that is preparing. The time is come......the
scourge of God appears.<a name="FNanchor_1190_1190" id="FNanchor_1190_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a>......After many
journeys and inquiries, we have learnt that the Five Cantons
will march to-day (Monday) to seize upon Hitzkylch, while
the main army assembles its banners at Baar, between Zug
and Cappel. Those from the valley of the Adige and the
Italians will arrive to-day or to-morrow." This letter, through
some unforeseen circumstance, did not reach Zurich till the
evening.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the messenger whom Lavater had sent&mdash;the
nephew of J. Winckler&mdash;creeping on his belly, gliding unperceived
past the sentinels, and clinging to the shrubs that
overhung the precipices, had succeeded in making his way
where no road had been cleared. On arriving near Zug,
he had discovered with alarm the banner and the militia
hastening from all sides at beat of drum: then traversing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
again these unknown passes, he had returned to Zurich with
this information.<a name="FNanchor_1191_1191" id="FNanchor_1191_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a></p>

<p>It was high time that the bandage should fall from the
eyes of the Zurichers; but the delusion was to endure to
the last. The council which was called together met in
small number. "The Five Cantons," said they, "are
making a little noise to frighten us, and to make us raise the
blockade."<a name="FNanchor_1192_1192" id="FNanchor_1192_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a> The council, however, decided on sending
Colonel Rodolph Dumysen and Ulric Funk to Cappel, to see
what was going on; and each one, tranquillized by this
unmeaning step, retired to rest.</p>

<p>They did not slumber long. Every hour brought fresh
messengers of alarm to Zurich. "The banners of four cantons
are assembled at Zug," said they. "They are only
waiting for Uri. The people of the free bailiwicks are
flocking to Cappel, and demanding arms......Help!
help!"</p>

<p>Before the break of day the council was again assembled,
and it ordered the convocation of the Two Hundred. An
old man, whose hair had grown gray on the battle-field and
in the council of the state&mdash;the banneret John Schweizer&mdash;raising
his head enfeebled by age, and darting the last beam,
as it were, from his eyes, exclaimed, "Now&mdash;at this very
moment, in God's name, send an advanced guard to Cappel,
and let the army, promptly collecting round the banner, follow
it immediately." He said no more; but the charm was
not yet broken. "The peasants of the free bailiwicks," said
some, "we know to be hasty, and easily carried away.
They make the matter greater than it really is. The wisest
plan is to wait for the report of the councillors." In Zurich
there was no longer either arm to defend or head to advise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WAR BEGINS.</div>

<p>It was seven in the morning, and the assembly was still
sitting, when Rodolph Gwerb, pastor of Rifferschwyl, near
Cappel, arrived in haste. "The people of the lordship of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
Knonau," said he, "are crowding round the convent, and
loudly calling for chiefs and for aid. The enemy is approaching.
Will our lords of Zurich (say they) abandon themselves,
and us with them? Do they wish to give us up to
slaughter?" The pastor, who had witnessed these mournful
scenes, spoke with animation. The councillors, whose infatuation
was to be prolonged to the end, were offended at his
message. "They want to make us act imprudently," replied
they, turning in their arm-chairs.</p>

<p>They had scarcely ceased speaking before a new messenger
appears, wearing on his features the marks of the
greatest terror: it was Schwyzer, landlord of the "Beech
Tree" on Mount Albis. "My lords Dumysen and Funck,"
said he, "have sent me to you with all speed to announce to
the council that the Five Cantons have seized upon Hytzkilch,
and that they are now collecting all their troops at
Baar. My lords remain in the bailiwicks to aid the frightened
inhabitants."</p>

<p>This time the most confident turned pale. Terror, so long
restrained, passed like a flash of lightning through every
heart.<a name="FNanchor_1193_1193" id="FNanchor_1193_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a> Hytzkilch was in the power of the enemy, and the
war was begun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A FEARFUL NIGHT.</div>

<p>It was resolved to expedite to Cappel a flying camp of six
hundred men with six guns; but the command was intrusted
to George Goldli, whose brother was in the army of the
Five Cantons, and he was enjoined to keep on the defensive.
Goldli and his troops had just left the city, when the captain-general
Lavater, summoning into the hall of the Smaller
Council the old banneret Schweizer, William Toning, captain
of the arquebusiers, J. Dennikon, captain of the artillery,
Zwingle, and some others, said to them, "Let us deliberate
promptly on the means of saving the canton and the city.
Let the tocsin immediately call out all the citizens." The
captain-general feared that the councils would shrink at
this proceeding, and he wished to raise the Landsturm by
the simple advice of the army and of Zwingle. "We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
cannot take it upon ourselves," said they, "the two councils
are still sitting; let us lay this proposition before them."
They hasten towards the place of meeting; but, fatal mischance!
there were only a few members of the Smaller Council
on the benches. "The consent of the Two Hundred is
necessary," said they. Again a new delay, and the enemy
is on the march. Two hours after noon the Great Council
met again, but only to make long and useless speeches.<a name="FNanchor_1194_1194" id="FNanchor_1194_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a> At
length the resolution was taken, and at seven in the evening
the tocsin began to sound in all the country districts.
Treason united with this dilatoriness, and persons who pretended
to be envoys from Zurich stopped the Landsturm in
many places, as being contrary to the opinion of the council.
A great number of citizens went to sleep again.</p>

<p>It was a fearful night. The thick darkness&mdash;a violent
storm&mdash;the alarm-bell ringing from every steeple&mdash;the people
running to arms&mdash;the noise of swords and guns&mdash;the
sound of trumpets and of drums, combined with the roaring
of the tempest, the distrust, discontent, and even treason, which
spread affliction in every quarter&mdash;the sobs of women and
of children&mdash;the cries which accompanied many a heartrending
adieu&mdash;an earthquake which occurred about nine
o'clock at night, as if nature herself had shuddered at the
blood that was about to be spilt, and which violently shook
the mountains and valleys:<a name="FNanchor_1195_1195" id="FNanchor_1195_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> all increased the terrors of this
fatal night,&mdash;a night to be followed by a still more fatal day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WAR.</div>

<p>While these events were transpiring, the Zurichers encamped
on the heights of Cappel to the number of about
one thousand men, fixed their eyes on Zug and upon the
lake, attentively watching every movement. On a sudden,
a little before night, they perceived a few barks filled with
soldiers coming from the side of Arth, and rowing across
the lake towards Zug. Their number increases&mdash;one boat
follows another&mdash;soon they distinctly hear the bellowing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
the bull (the horn) of Uri,<a name="FNanchor_1196_1196" id="FNanchor_1196_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a> and they discern the banner.
The barks draw near Zug; they are moored to the shore,
which is lined with an immense crowd. The warriors of
Uri and the arquebusiers of the Adige spring up and leap
on shore, where they are received with acclamations, and
take up their quarters for the night: behold the enemies
assembled! The council are informed with all speed.</p>

<p>The agitation was still greater at Zurich than at Cappel:
the confusion was increased by uncertainty. The enemy
attacking them on different sides at once, they knew not where
to carry assistance. Two hours after midnight five hundred
men with four guns quitted the city for Bremgarten, and
three or four hundred men with five guns for Wadenshwyl.
They turned to the right and to the left, while the enemy
was in front.</p>

<p>Alarmed at its own weakness, the council resolved to
apply without delay to the cities of the christian co-burghery.
"As this revolt," wrote they, "has no other origin than the
Word of God, we entreat you once&mdash;twice&mdash;thrice, as loudly,
as seriously, as firmly, and as earnestly, as our ancient
alliances and our christian co-burghery permit and command
us to do&mdash;to set forth without delay with all your forces.
Haste! haste! haste! Act as promptly as possible<a name="FNanchor_1197_1197" id="FNanchor_1197_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a>&mdash;the
danger is yours as well as ours." Thus spake Zurich;
but it was already too late.</p>

<p>At break of day the banner was raised before the town-house;
instead of flaunting proudly in the wind, it hung drooping
down the staff&mdash;a sad omen that filled many minds with
fear. Lavater took up his station under the standard; but
a long period elapsed before a few hundred soldiers could
be got together.<a name="FNanchor_1198_1198" id="FNanchor_1198_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a> In the square and in all the city disorder
and confusion prevailed. The troops, fatigued by a hasty
march or by long waiting, were faint and discouraged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE'S DEPARTURE.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>At ten o'clock, only 700 men were under arms. The
selfish, the lukewarm, the friends of Rome and of the foreign
pensioners, had remained at home. A few old men who had
more courage than strength&mdash;several members of the two
councils who were devoted to the holy cause of God's Word&mdash;many
ministers of the Church who desired to live and die
with the Reform&mdash;the boldest of the townspeople and a certain
number of peasants, especially those from the neighbourhood
of the city&mdash;such were the defenders who, wanting that
moral force so necessary for victory, incompletely armed,
without uniform, crowded in disorder around the banner of
Zurich.</p>

<p>The army should have numbered at least 4000 men;
they waited still; the usual oath had not been administered;
and yet courier after courier arrived, breathless and in
disorder, announcing the terrible danger that threatened Zurich.
All this disorderly crowd is agitated&mdash;they no longer
wait for the commands of their chiefs, and many without
taking the oath rush through the gates. About 200 men
thus set out in confusion. All those who remained prepared
to depart.</p>

<p>Then was Zwingle seen to issue from a house before
which a caparisoned horse was stamping impatiently; it was
his own. His look was firm, but dimmed by sorrow. He
parted from his wife, his children, and his numerous friends,
without deceiving himself, and with a bruised heart.<a name="FNanchor_1199_1199" id="FNanchor_1199_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a> He
observed the thick waterspout, which, driven by a terrible
wind, advanced whirling towards him. Alas! he had himself
called up this hurricane by quitting the atmosphere of the
Gospel of peace, and throwing himself into the midst of
political passions. He was convinced that he would be the
first victim. Fifteen days before the attack of the Waldstettes,
he had said from the pulpit: "I know what is the
meaning of all this:&mdash;it is all about me. All this comes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
pass&mdash;in order that I may die."<a name="FNanchor_1200_1200" id="FNanchor_1200_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a> The council, according to
an ancient custom, had called upon him to accompany the
army as its chaplain. Zwingle did not hesitate. He prepared
himself without surprise and without anger,&mdash;with
the calmness of a Christian who placed himself confidently
in the hands of his God. If the cause of Reform was
doomed to perish, he was ready to perish with it. Surrounded
by his weeping wife and friends&mdash;by his children who
clung to his garments to detain him, he quitted that house
where he had tasted so much happiness. At the moment
that his hand was upon his horse, just as he was about to
mount, the animal violently started back several paces,
and when he was at last in the saddle, it refused for a time
to move, rearing and prancing backwards, like that horse
which the greatest captain of modern times had mounted as
he was about to cross the Niemen. Many in Zurich at that
time thought with the soldier of the Grand Army when he
saw Napoleon on the ground: "It is a bad omen! a Roman
would go back!"<a name="FNanchor_1201_1201" id="FNanchor_1201_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a> Zwingle having at last mastered his
horse, gave the reins, applied the spur, started forward, and
disappeared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SCENE OF WAR.</div>

<p>At eleven o'clock the flag was struck, and all who remained
in the square&mdash;about 500 men&mdash;began their march along
with it. The greater part were torn with difficulty from
the arms of their families, and walked sad and silent, as if
they were going to the scaffold instead of battle. There was
no order&mdash;no plan; the men were isolated and scattered,
some running before, some after the colours, their extreme
confusion presenting a fearful appearance;<a name="FNanchor_1202_1202" id="FNanchor_1202_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a> so much so,
that those who remained behind&mdash;the women, the children,
and the old men, filled with gloomy forebodings, beat their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
breasts as they saw them pass, and many years after, the remembrance
of this day of tumult and mourning drew this
groan from Oswald Myconius: "Whenever I recall it to
mind, it is as if a sword pierced my heart." Zwingle, armed
according to the usage of the chaplains of the Confederation,
rode mournfully behind this distracted multitude.
Myconius, when he saw him, was nigh fainting.<a name="FNanchor_1203_1203" id="FNanchor_1203_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a> Zwingle
disappeared, and Oswald remained behind to weep.</p>

<p>He did not shed tears alone; in all quarters were heard
lamentations, and every house was changed into a house
of prayer.<a name="FNanchor_1204_1204" id="FNanchor_1204_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a> In the midst of this universal sorrow, one woman
remained silent; her only cry was a bitter heart, her only
language the mild and suppliant eye of faith:&mdash;this was
Anna, Zwingle's wife. She had seen her husband depart&mdash;her
son, her brother, a great number of intimate friends and
near relations, whose approaching death she foreboded. But
her soul, strong as that of her husband, offered to God the
sacrifice of her holiest affections. Gradually the defenders
of Zurich precipitate their march, and the tumult dies away
in the distance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ENEMY AT ZUG.</div>

<p>VII. This night, which was so stormy in Zurich, had not
been calmer at Cappel. They had received the most alarming
reports one after another. It was necessary to take up a
position that would allow the troops assembled round the
convent to resist the enemy's attack until the arrival of the
reinforcements that were expected from the city. They
cast their eyes on a small hill, which lying to the north
towards Zurich, and traversed by the highroad, presented an
uneven but sufficiently extensive surface. A deep ditch
that surrounded it on three sides defended the approaches;
but a small bridge, that was the only issue on the side of
Zurich, rendered a precipitate retreat very dangerous. On
the south-west was a wood of beech-trees; on the south, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
the direction of Zug, was the highroad and a marshy valley.
"Lead us to the Granges," cried all the soldiers. They
were conducted thither. The artillery was stationed near
some ruins. The line of battle was drawn up on the side of
the monastery and of Zug, and sentinels were placed at the
foot of the slope.</p>

<p>Meantime, the signal is given at Zug and Baar: the drums
beat: the soldiers of the Five Cantons take up their arms.
A universal feeling of joy animates them. The churches are
opened, the bells ring, and the serried ranks of the cantons
enter the cathedral of St. Oswald; Mass is celebrated; the
Host is offered up for the sins of the people, and all the army
begin their march at nine o'clock, with banners flying. The
avoyer John Golder commands the contingent of Lucerne;
the landamman Jacques Troguer, that of Uri; the landamman
Rychmut, a mortal enemy of the Reformation, that of
Schwytz; the landamman Zellger, that of Unterwalden; and
Oswald Dooss that of Zug. Eight thousand men march in
order of battle: all the picked men of the Five Cantons are
there. Fresh and active after a quiet night, and having only
one short league to cross before reaching the enemy, these
haughty Waldstettes advance with a firm and regular step
under the command of their chiefs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARMY OF ZURICH.</div>

<p>On reaching the common meadow of Zug, they halt to
take the oath: every hand is upraised to heaven, and all
swear to avenge themselves. They were about to resume
their march, when some aged men made signs to them to stop.
"Comrades," they said, "we have long offended God. Our
blasphemies, our oaths, our wars, our revenge, our pride, our
drunkenness, our adulteries, the gold of the stranger to whom
our hands have been extended, and all the disorders in which
we have indulged, have so provoked his anger, that if he
should punish us to-day, we should only receive the desert of
our crimes." The emotion of the chiefs had passed into the
ranks. All the army bend the knee in the midst of the
plain; deep silence prevails, and every soldier, with bended
head, crosses himself devoutly, and repeats in a low voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
five paters, as many aves, and the credo. One might have
said that they were for a time in the midst of a vast and stilly
desert. Suddenly the noise of an immense crowd is again
heard. The army rises up. "Soldiers," said the captains,
"you know the cause of this war. Bear your wives and
your children continually before your eyes."</p>

<p>Then the chief usher (<i>grand sautier</i>) of Lucerne, wearing
the colours of the canton, approaches the chiefs of the army:
they place in his hands the declaration of war, dated on that
very day, and sealed with the arms of Zug. He then sets
off on horseback, preceded by a trumpeter, to carry this
paper to the commander of the Zurichers.</p>

<p>It was eleven in the morning. The Zurichers soon discovered
the enemy's army, and cast a sorrowful glance on
the small force they were able to oppose to it. Every minute
the danger increased. All bent their knees, their eyes were
raised to heaven, and every Zuricher uttered a cry from the
bottom of his heart, praying for deliverance from God. As
soon as the prayer was ended, they got ready for battle.
There were at that time about twelve hundred men under
arms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BATTLE OF CAPPEL.</div>

<p>At noon the trumpet of the Five Cantons sounded not far
from the advanced posts. Goldli, having collected the members
of the two councils who happened to be with the army,
as well as the commissioned and non-commissioned officers,
and having ranged them in a circle, ordered the secretary
Rheinhard to read the declaration of which the Sautier of
Lucerne was the bearer. After the reading, Goldli opened
a council of war. "We are few in number, and the forces
of our adversaries are great," said Landolt, bailiff of Marpac,
"but I will here await the enemy in the name of God."
"Wait!" cried the captain of the halberdiers, Rodolph Zigler;
"impossible! let us rather take advantage of the ditch
that cuts the road to effect our retreat, and let us everywhere
raise a levée <i>en masse</i>." This was in truth the only means
of safety. But Rudi Gallmann, considering every step backwards
as an act of cowardice, cried out, stamping his feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
forcibly on the earth, and casting a fiery glance around him,
"Here&mdash;here shall be my grave!"<a name="FNanchor_1205_1205" id="FNanchor_1205_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a>&mdash;"It is now too late to
retire with honour," said other officers. "This day is in the
hands of God. Let us suffer whatever he lays upon us." It
was put to the vote.</p>

<p>The members of the council had scarcely raised their hands
in token of assent, when a great noise was heard around them.
"The captain! the captain!" cried a soldier from the outposts
who arrived in haste. "Silence, silence!" replied the
ushers, driving him back; "they are holding a council!"&mdash;"It
is no longer time to hold a council," replied the soldier.
"Conduct me immediately to the captain."......"Our sentinels
are falling back," cried he with an agitated voice, as
he arrived before Goldli. "The enemy is there&mdash;they are
advancing through the forest with all their forces and with
great tumult." He had not ceased speaking, before the sentinels,
who were in truth retiring on all sides, ran up, and
the army of the Five Cantons was soon seen climbing the
slope of Ifelsberg in face of the Granges, and pointing their
guns. The leaders of the Waldstettes were examining the
position, and seeking to discover by what means their army
could reach that of Zurich. The Zurichers were asking themselves
the same question. The nature of the ground prevented
the Waldstettes from passing below the convent, but
they could arrive by another quarter. Ulric Brüder, under
bailiff of Husen in the canton of Zurich, fixed his anxious
look on the beech-wood. "It is thence that the enemy will
fall upon us!" "Axes&mdash;axes!" immediately cried several
voices; "let us cut down the trees!"<a name="FNanchor_1206_1206" id="FNanchor_1206_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a> Goldli, the abbot,
and several others, were opposed to this: "If we stop up the
wood, by throwing down the trees, we shall ourselves be
unable to work our guns in that direction," said they.&mdash;"Well!
at least let us place some arquebusiers in that
quarter."&mdash;"We are already so small a number," replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
the captain, "that it will be imprudent to divide the forces."
Neither wisdom nor courage were to save Zurich. They
once more invoked the help of God, and waited in expectation.</p>

<p>At one o'clock the Five Cantons fired the first gun: the
ball passing over the convent, fell below the Granges; a
second passed over the line of battle; a third struck a hedge
close to the ruins. The Zurichers, seeing the battle was begun,
replied with courage; but the slowness and awkwardness
with which the artillery was served in those days
prevented any great loss being inflicted on either side. When
the enemy perceived this, they ordered their advanced guard
to descend from Ifelsberg and to reach the Granges through
the meadow; and soon the whole army of the Cantons advanced
in this direction, but with difficulty and over bad
roads. Some arquebusiers of Zurich came and announced
the disorder of the Cantons. "Brave Zurichers," cried Rudi
Gallmann, "if we attack them now, it is all over with them."
At these words some of the soldiers prepared to enter the wood
on the left, to fall upon the disheartened Waldstettes. But
Goldli perceiving this movement, cried out: "Where are
you going?&mdash;do you not know that we have agreed not to
separate?" He then ordered the skirmishers to be recalled,
so that the wood remained entirely open to the enemy.
They were satisfied with discharging a few random shots
from time to time to prevent the Cantons from establishing
themselves there. The firing of the artillery continued
until three o'clock, and announced far and wide, even to
Bremgarten and Zurich, that the battle had begun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MARCH.</div>

<p>In the meanwhile the great banner of Zurich and all those
who surrounded it, among whom was Zwingle, came advancing
in disorder towards the Albis. For a year past
the gaiety of the reformer had entirely disappeared: he was
grave, melancholy, easily moved, having a weight on his
heart that seemed to crush it. Often would he throw himself
weeping at the feet of his Master, and seek in prayer the
strength of which he stood in need. No one had ever observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
in him any irritation; on the contrary, he had received
with mildness the counsels that had been offered, and had
remained tenderly attached to men whose convictions
were not the same as his own. He was now advancing mournfully
along the road to Cappel; and John Maaler of Winterthour,
who was riding a few paces behind him, heard his groans
and sighs, intermingled with fervent prayers. If any one
spoke to him, he was found firm and strong in the peace
that proceeds from faith; but he did not conceal his conviction
that he should never see his family or church again.
Thus advanced the forces of Zurich. Awful march! resembling
rather a funeral procession then an army going to
battle.</p>

<p>As they approached they saw express after express gallopping
along the road from Cappel, begging the Zurichers
to hasten to the defence of their brothers.<a name="FNanchor_1207_1207" id="FNanchor_1207_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a></p>

<p>At Adliswil, having passed the bridge under which flow
the impetuous waters of the Sihl, and traversed the village
through the midst of women, children, and old men, who,
standing before their cottages, looked with sadness on this
disorderly troop, they began to ascend the Albis. They
were about half way from Cappel when the first cannon-shot
was heard. They stop, they listen: a second, a third succeeds......There
is no longer any doubt. The glory, the
very existence of the republic are endangered, and they are
not present to defend it! The blood curdles in their veins.
On a sudden they arouse, and each one begins to run to the
support of his brothers. But the road over the Albis was
much steeper than it is in our days. The badly harnessed
artillery could not ascend it; the old men, the citizens, little
habituated to marching, and covered with weighty armour,
advanced with difficulty: and yet they formed the greater
portion of the troops. They were seen stopping one after
another, panting and exhausted, along the sides of the road
near the thickets and ravines of the Albis, leaning against a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
beech or an ash tree, and looking with dispirited eyes to
the summit of the mountain covered with thick pines.</p>

<p>They resume their march, however; the horsemen and
the most intrepid of the foot-soldiers hasten onwards, and
having reached the "Beech Tree," on the top of the mountain,
halt to take council.</p>

<p>What a prospect then extended before their eyes! Zurich,
the lake and its smiling shores&mdash;those orchards, those
fertile fields, those vine-clad hills, almost the whole of the
canton. Alas! soon, perhaps, to be devastated by the Forest-bands.</p>

<p>Scarcely had these noble-minded men begun to deliberate,
when fresh messengers from Cappel appear before them
and exclaim, "Hasten forwards!" At these words many
of the Zurichers prepared to gallop towards the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_1208_1208" id="FNanchor_1208_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1208_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a>
Toning, the captain of the arquebusiers, stopt them. "My
good friends," cried he to them, "against such great forces
what can we do alone? Let us wait here until our people
are assembled, and then let us fall upon the enemy with the
whole army."&mdash;"Yes, if we had an army," bitterly replied
the captain-general, who, in despair of saving the republic,
thought only of dying with glory; "but we have only a
banner and no soldiers."&mdash;"How can we stay calmly upon
these heights," said Zwingle, "while we hear the shots that
are fired at our fellow-citizens? In the name of God I will
march towards our warriors, prepared to die in order to save
them."<a name="FNanchor_1209_1209" id="FNanchor_1209_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1209_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a>&mdash;"And I too," added the aged banneret Schweizer.
"As for you," continued he, turning with a contemptuous
look towards Toning, "wait till you are a little recovered."&mdash;"I
am quite as much refreshed as you," replied Toning,
the colour mantling on his face, "and you shall soon see
whether I cannot fight." All hastened their steps towards
the field of battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p><p>The descent is rapid; they plunge into the woods, pass
through the village of Husen, and at length arrive near the
Granges. It was three o'clock when the banner crossed
the narrow bridge that led thither; and there were so few
soldiers round it that every one trembled as he beheld this
venerated standard thus exposed to the attacks of so formidable
an enemy. The army of the Cantons was at that moment
deploying before the eyes of the new-comers. Zwingle
gazed upon this terrible spectacle. Behold, then, these
phalanxes of soldiers!&mdash;a few minutes more, and the labours
of eleven years will be destroyed perhaps for ever!......</p>

<p>A citizen of Zurich, one Leonard Bourkhard, who was
ill-disposed towards the reformer, said to him in a harsh tone,
"Well, Master Ulric, what do you say about this business?
Are the radishes salt enough?......who will eat them now?"<a name="FNanchor_1210_1210" id="FNanchor_1210_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a>
"I," replied Zwingle, "and many a brave man who is
here in the hands of God; for we are his in life and in
death."&mdash;"And I too&mdash;I will help eat them," resumed Bourkhard
immediately, ashamed of his brutality,&mdash;"I will risk
my life for them." And he did so, and many others with
him, adds the chronicle.</p>

<p>It was four o'clock; the sun was sinking rapidly; the
Waldstettes did not advance, and the Zurichers began to
think that the attack would be put off till the morrow. In
fact, the chiefs of the Five Cantons seeing the great banner
of Zurich arrive, the night near at hand, and the impossibility
of crossing under the fire of the Zurichers the marsh and
the ditch that separated the combatants, were looking for a
place in which their troops might pass the night. "If, at
this moment, any mediators had appeared," says Bullinger,
"their proposals would have been accepted."</p>

<div class="sidenote">BATTLE OF CAPPEL.</div>

<p>The soldiers, observing the hesitation of their chiefs, began
to murmur loudly. "The big ones abandon us," said one.
"The captains fear to bite the fox's tail," said another.
"Not to attack them," cried they all, "is to ruin our cause."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
During this time a daring man was preparing the skilful
man&oelig;uvre that was to decide the fate of the day. A warrior
of Uri, John Jauch, formerly bailiff of Sargans, a good
marksman and experienced soldier, having taken a few men
with him, moved towards the right of the army of the Five
Cantons, crept into the midst of the clump of beech-trees
that, by forming a semicircle to the east, unite the hill of
Ifelsberg to that of the Granges,<a name="FNanchor_1211_1211" id="FNanchor_1211_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a> found the wood empty, arrived
to within a few paces of the Zurichers, and there, hidden
behind the trees, remarked unperceived the smallness
of their numbers, and their want of caution. Then, stealthily
retiring, he went to the chiefs at the very moment the discontent
was on the point of bursting out. "Now is the time
to attack the enemy," cried he. "Dear gossip," replied
Troquer, captain-in-chief of Uri, "you do not mean to say
that we should set to work at so late an hour; besides, the
men are preparing their quarters, and everybody knows
what it cost our fathers at Naples and Marignan for having
commenced the attack a little before night. And then it is
Innocents' day, and our ancestors have never given battle
on a feast-day."<a name="FNanchor_1212_1212" id="FNanchor_1212_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a>&mdash;"Don't think about the Innocents of the
calendar," replied Jauch, "but let us rather remember the
innocents that we have left in our cottages." Gaspard Goldli
of Zurich, brother of the commander of the Granges, added
his entreaties to those of the warrior of Uri. "We must
either beat the Zurichers to-night," said he, "or be beaten
by them to-morrow. Take your choice."</p>

<div class="sidenote">AMBUSCADE.</div>

<p>All was unavailing; the chiefs were inflexible, and the
army prepared to take up its quarters. Then the warrior of
Uri, understanding like his fellow-countryman Tell that
great evils require great remedies, drew his sword and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
cried: "Let all true confederates follow me."<a name="FNanchor_1213_1213" id="FNanchor_1213_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a> Then hastily
leaping to his saddle, he spurred his horse into the forest;<a name="FNanchor_1214_1214" id="FNanchor_1214_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a>
and immediately arquebusiers, soldiers from the Adige, and
many other warriors of the Five Cantons, especially from
Unterwalden&mdash;in all about 300 men, rushed into the wood after
him. At this sight Jauch no longer doubts of the victory of
the Waldstettes. He dismounts and falls upon his knees,
"for," says Tschudi, "he was a man who feared God."
All his followers do the same, and together invoke the aid
of God, of his holy mother, and of all the heavenly host,
They then advance; but soon the warrior of Uri, wishing to
expose no one but himself, halts his troops, and glides from
tree to tree to the verge of the wood. Observing that the enemy
was as incautious as ever, he rejoins his arquebusiers,
leads them stealthily forward, and posts them silently behind
the trees of the forest,<a name="FNanchor_1215_1215" id="FNanchor_1215_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a> enjoining them to take their aim so
as not to miss their men. During this time the chiefs of
the Five Cantons, foreseeing that this rash man was about to
bring on the action, decided against their will, and collected
their soldiers around the banners.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>VIII. The Zurichers, fearing that the enemy would seize
upon the road that led to their capital, were then directing
part of their troops and their guns to a low hill by which
it was commanded. At the very moment that the invisible
arquebusiers stationed among the beech trees were taking
their aim, this detachment passed near the little wood. The
deepest silence prevails in this solitude: each one posted there
picks out the man he desires to bring down, and Jauch exclaims:
"In the name of the Holy Trinity&mdash;of God the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost&mdash;of the Holy Mother of
God, and of all the heavenly host&mdash;fire!" At the word the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
deadly balls issue from the wood, and a murderous carnage
in the ranks of Zurich follows this terrible discharge. The
battle, which had begun four hours ago, and which had never
appeared to be a serious attack, now underwent an unforeseen
change. The sword was not again to be returned to
the scabbard until it had been bathed in torrents of blood.
Those of the Zurichers who had not fallen at this first discharge,
lie flat on the ground, so that the balls pass over their
heads; but they soon spring up, saying: "Shall we allow
ourselves to be butchered? No! let us rather attack the
enemy!" Lavater seizes a lance, and rushing into the foremost
rank exclaims: "Soldiers, uphold the honour of God
and of our lords, and behave like brave men!" Zwingle,
silent and collected, like nature before the bursting of the
tempest, was there also halberd in hand. "Master Ulric,"
said Bernard Sprungli, "speak to the people and encourage
them." "Warriors!" said Zwingle, "fear nothing. If we
are this day to be defeated, still our cause is good. Commend
yourselves to God!"</p>

<p>The Zurichers quickly turn the artillery they were dragging
to another quarter, and point it against the wood; but
their bullets, instead of striking the enemy, only reach the
top of the trees, and tear off a few branches that fall upon the
skirmishers.<a name="FNanchor_1216_1216" id="FNanchor_1216_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a></p>

<p>Rychmuth, the landamman of Schwytz, came up at a gallop
to recall the volunteers; but seeing the battle begun, he ordered
the whole army to advance. Immediately the five
banners moved forward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BATTLE OF CAPPEL.</div>

<p>But already Jauch's skirmishers, rushing from among the
trees, had fallen impetuously upon the Zurichers, charging
with their long and pointed halberds. "Heretics! sacrilegists!"
cried they, "we have you at last!"&mdash;"Man-sellers,
idolaters, impious Papists!" replied the Zurichers, "is it really
you?" At first a shower of stones fell from both parties and
wounded several; immediately they come to close quarters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
The resistance of the Zurichers was terrible.<a name="FNanchor_1217_1217" id="FNanchor_1217_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a> Each struck
with the sword or with the halberd: at last the soldiers of the
Five Cantons were driven back in disorder. The Zurichers
advanced, but in so doing lost the advantages of their position,
and got entangled in the marsh. Some Roman-catholic
historians pretend that this flight of their troops was a stratagem
to draw the Zurichers into the snare.<a name="FNanchor_1218_1218" id="FNanchor_1218_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a></p>

<p>In the mean time the army of the Five Cantons hasten
through the wood. Burning with courage and with anger,
they eagerly quicken their steps; from the midst of the
beech-trees there resounded a confused and savage noise&mdash;a
frightful murmur; the ground shook; one might have said
that the forest was uttering a horrible roar, or that witches
were holding their nocturnal revels.<a name="FNanchor_1219_1219" id="FNanchor_1219_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a> In vain do the bravest
of the Zurichers offer an intrepid resistance: the Waldstettes
have the advantage in every quarter. "They are surrounding
us," cried some. "Our men are fleeing," said
others. A man from the canton of Zug mingling with the
Zurichers, and pretending to be of their party, exclaims:
"Fly, fly, brave Zurichers, you are betrayed!" Thus everything
is against Zurich. Even the hand of Him who is
the disposer of battles, turns against this people. Thus was
it also in times of old that God frequently chastised his
own people of Israel by the Assyrian sword. A panic
terror seizes upon the bravest, and the disorder spreads
everywhere with frightful rapidity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BANNER IN DANGER.</div>

<p>In the meanwhile the aged Schweizer had raised the great
banner with a firm hand, and all the picked men of Zurich
were drawn up around it; but soon their ranks were thinned.
John Kammli, charged with the defence of the standard,
having observed the small number of combatants that remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
upon the field of battle, said to the banneret: "Let
us lower the banner, my lord, and save it, for our people are
flying shamefully:"&mdash;"Warriors, remain firm," replied
the aged banneret, whom no danger had ever shaken. The
disorder augmented&mdash;the number of fugitives increased every
minute; the old man stood fast, amazed and immoveable
as an aged oak beaten by a frightful hurricane. He received
unflinchingly the blows that fell upon him, and alone
resisted the terrible storm. Kammli seized him by the arm:
"My lord," said he again, "lower the banner, or else we
shall lose it: there is no more glory to be reaped here!"
The banneret, who was already mortally wounded, exclaimed:
"Alas! must the city of Zurich be so punished!"
Then, dragged off by Kammli, who held him by the arm,
he retreated as far as the ditch. The weight of years, and
the wounds with which he was covered, did not permit him
to cross it. He fell in the mire at the bottom, still holding
the glorious standard, whose folds dropped on the other bank.</p>

<p>The enemy ran up with loud shouts, being attracted by
the colours of Zurich, as the bull by the gladiator's flag.
Kammli seeing this, unhesitatingly leaps to the bottom of the
ditch, and lays hold of the stiff and dying hands of his chief,
in order to preserve the precious ensign, which they tightly
grasped. But it is in vain; the hands of the aged Schweizer
will not loose the standard. "My lord banneret!" cried this
faithful servant, "it is no longer in your power to defend it."
The hands of the banneret, already stiffened in death, still
refuse; upon which Kammli violently tears away the sacred
standard, leaps upon the other bank, and rushes with his
treasure far from the steps of the enemy. The last Zurichers
at this moment reach the ditch, they fall one after another
upon the expiring banneret, and thus hasten his death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BANNER SAVED.</div>

<p>Kammli, however, having received a wound from a gunshot,
his march was retarded, and soon the Waldstettes surround
him with their swords. The Zuricher, holding the
banner in one hand, and his sword in the other, defends himself
bravely. One of the Waldstettes catches hold of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
staff&mdash;another seizes the flag itself and tears it. Kammli with
one blow of his sword cuts down the former, and striking
around him, calls out: "To the rescue, brave Zurichers!
save the honour and the banner of our lords." The assailants
increase in number, and the warrior is about to fall, when
Adam Næff of Wollenwyd rushes up sword in hand, and the
head of the Waldstette who had torn the colours rolls upon the
plain, and his blood gushes out upon the flag of Zurich.
Dumysen, member of the Smaller Council, supports Næff
with his halberd, and both deal such lusty blows, that they
succeed in disengaging the standard-bearer. He, although
dangerously wounded, springs forward, holding the blood-stained
folds of the banner in one hand, which he carries
off hastily, dragging the staff behind him. With fierce look
and fiery eye, he thus passes sword in hand through the midst
of friends and enemies: he crosses plains, woods, and
marshes, everywhere leaving traces of his blood, which flows
from numerous wounds. Two of his enemies, one from
Schwytz, the other from Zug&mdash;were particularly eager in
his pursuit. "Heretic! villain!" cried they, "surrender
and give us the banner."&mdash;"You shall have my life first,"
replied the Zuricher. Then the two hostile soldiers, who
were embarrassed by their cuirasses, stopped a moment to
take them off. Kammli took advantage of this to get in
advance: he ran; Huber, Dumysen, and Dantzler of Naenikon
were at his side. They all four thus arrived near
Husen, half-way up the Albis. They had still to climb the
steepest part of the mountain. Huber falls covered with
wounds. Dumysen, the colonel-general, who had fought as a
private soldier, almost reaches the church of Husen, and there
he falls lifeless: and two of his sons, in the flower of youth,
soon lie stretched on the battle-field that has drunk their
father's blood. Kammli takes a few steps further; but halts
erelong, exhausted and panting, near a hedge that he would
have to clear, and discovers his two enemies, and other
Waldstettes running from all sides, like birds of prey, towards
the wavering standard of Zurich. The strength of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
Kammli sinks rapidly, his eyes grow dim, thick darkness surrounds
him: a hand of lead fastens him to the ground.
Then, mustering all his expiring strength, he flings the
standard on the other side of the hedge, exclaiming: "Is
there any brave Zuricher near me? Let him preserve the
banner and the honour of our lords! As for me, I can do no
more!" Then casting a last look to heaven, he adds:
"May God be my helper!" He fell exhausted by this last
effort. Dantzler, who came up, flung away his sword, sprung
over the hedge, seized the banner, and cried, "With the aid
of God, I will carry it off." He then rapidly climbed the
Albis, and at last placed the ancient standard of Zurich in
safety. God, on whom these warriors fixed all their hopes,
had heard their prayers, but the noblest blood of the republic
had been spilt.</p>

<p>The enemy were victorious at all points. The soldiers
of the Five Cantons, and particularly those of Unterwalden,
long hardened in the wars of the Milanese, showed themselves
more merciless towards their confederates than they
had ever been towards foreigners. At the beginning of
the battle, Goldli had taken flight, and soon after he quitted
Zurich for ever. Lavater, the captain-general, after having
fought valiantly, had fallen into the ditch. He was dragged
out by a soldier, and had escaped.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TERRIBLE SLAUGHTER.</div>

<p>The most distinguished men of Zurich fell one after another
under the blows of the Waldstettes.<a name="FNanchor_1220_1220" id="FNanchor_1220_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a> Rudi Gallmann found
the glorious tomb he had wished for, and his two brothers
stretched beside him left their father's house desolate. Toning,
captain of the arquebusiers, died for his country as he
had foretold. All the pride of the population of Zurich,
seven members of the Smaller Council, nineteen members
of the Two Hundred, sixty-five citizens of the town, four
hundred and seventeen from the rural districts: the father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
in the midst of his children,&mdash;the brother surrounded by his
brothers,&mdash;lay on the field.</p>

<p>Gerold Meyer of Knonau, son of Anna Zwingle; at that
time twenty-two years of age, and already a member of
the council of Two Hundred,&mdash;a husband and a father,&mdash;had
rushed into the foremost ranks with all the impetuosity
of youth. "Surrender, and your life shall be spared," cried
some of the warriors of the Five Cantons, who desired to save
him. "It is better for me to die with honour than to yield
with disgrace," replied the son of Anna, and immediately
struck by a mortal blow, he fell and expired not far from
the castle of his ancestors.</p>

<p>The ministers were those who paid proportionally the
greatest tribute on this bloody day. The sword that was
at work on the heights of Cappel thirsted for their blood:
twenty-five of them fell beneath its stroke. The Waldstettes
trembled with rage when they discovered one of these
heretical preachers, and sacrificed him with enthusiasm,
as a chosen victim, to the Virgin and the saints. There
has, perhaps, never been any battle in which so many men of
the Word of God have bitten the dust. Almost everywhere
the pastors had marched at the head of their flocks. One
might have said that Cappel was an assembly of christian
churches rather than an army of Swiss companies. The
Abbot Joner, receiving a mortal wound near the ditch,
expired in sight of his own monastery. The people of Zug,
in pursuit of the enemy, uttered a cry of anguish as they
passed his body, remembering all the good he had done
them.<a name="FNanchor_1221_1221" id="FNanchor_1221_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a> Schmidt of Kuprach, stationed on the field of battle
in the midst of his parishioners, fell surrounded by forty
of their bodies,<a name="FNanchor_1222_1222" id="FNanchor_1222_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a> Geroldseck, John Haller, and many other
pastors, at the head of their flocks, suddenly met in a terrible
and unforeseen manner the Lord whom they had preached.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE'S LAST MOMENTS.</div>

<p>But the death of one individual far surpassed all others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
Zwingle was at the post of danger, the helmet on his head,
the sword hanging at his side, the battle-axe in his hand.<a name="FNanchor_1223_1223" id="FNanchor_1223_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a>
Scarcely had the action begun, when, stooping to console a
dying man, says J. J. Hottinger, a stone hurled by the vigorous
arm of a Waldstette struck him on the head and closed
his lips. Yet Zwingle arose, when two other blows which
struck him successively on the leg,<a name="FNanchor_1224_1224" id="FNanchor_1224_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a> threw him down again.
Twice more he stands up; but a fourth time he receives a
thrust from a lance, he staggers, and sinking beneath so
many wounds, falls on his knees. Does not the darkness
that is spreading around him announce a still thicker darkness
that is about to cover the Church? Zwingle turns
away from such sad thoughts; once more he uplifts that head
which had been so bold, and gazing with calm eye upon
the trickling blood, exclaims: "What evil is this? They
can indeed kill the body, but they cannot kill the soul!"<a name="FNanchor_1225_1225" id="FNanchor_1225_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a>
These were his last words.</p>

<p>He had scarcely uttered them ere he fell backwards.
There under a tree (Zwingle's Pear-tree) in a meadow, he
remained lying on his back, with clasped hands and eyes upturned
to heaven.<a name="FNanchor_1226_1226" id="FNanchor_1226_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FURNACE OF TRIAL.</div>

<p>While the bravest were pursuing the scattered soldiers of
Zurich, the stragglers of the Five Cantons had pounced like
hungry ravens on the field of battle. Torch in hand, these
wretches prowled among the dead, casting looks of irritation
around them, and lighting up the features of their expiring
victims by the dull glimmering of these funereal torches.
They turned over the bodies of the wounded and the dead;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
they tortured and they stripped them.<a name="FNanchor_1227_1227" id="FNanchor_1227_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a> If they found any
who were still sensible, they cried out, "Call upon the saints
and confess to our priests!" If the Zurichers, faithful to
their creed, rejected these cruel invitations, these men, who
were as cowardly as they were fanatical, pierced them with
their lances, or dashed out their brains with the butt-ends of
their arquebuses. The Roman-catholic historian, Salat of Lucerne,
makes a boast of this. "They were left to die like
infidel dogs, or were slain with the sword, or the spear, that
they might go so much the quicker to the devil, with whose
help they had fought so desperately."<a name="FNanchor_1228_1228" id="FNanchor_1228_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a> If any of the soldiers
of the Five Cantons had recognised a Zuricher against whom
they had any grudge, with dry eyes, disdainful mouth, and
features changed by anger, they drew near the unhappy
creature, writhing in the agonies of death, and said: "Well!
has your heretical faith preserved you? Ah ha! it was
pretty clearly seen to-day who had the true faith......To-day
we have dragged your Gospel in the mud, and you
too, even you are covered with your own blood. God, the
Virgin, and the saints have punished you." Scarcely had
they uttered these words before they plunged their swords
into their enemy's bosom. "Mass or death!" was their
watchword.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE'S LAST MOMENTS.</div>

<p>Thus triumphed the Waldstettes; but the pious Zurichers
who expired on the field of battle called to mind that they
had for God one who has said: "<i>If ye endure chastening, God
dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the
father chasteneth not?</i>"&mdash;"<i>Though he slay me, yet will I
trust in him.</i>" It is in the furnace of trial that the God of
the Gospel conceals the pure gold of his most precious blessings.
This punishment was necessary to turn aside the
Church of Zurich from the "broad ways" of the world,
and lead it back to the "narrow ways" of the Spirit and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
life. In a political history, a defeat like that of Cappel
would be styled a great misfortune; but in a history of
the Church of Jesus Christ, such a blow, inflicted by the
hand of the Father himself, ought rather to be called a great
blessing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Zwingle lay extended under the tree, near the
road by which the mass of the people was passing. The
shouts of the victors, the groans of the dying, those flickering
torches borne from corpse to corpse, Zurich humbled, the
cause of Reform lost,&mdash;all cried aloud to him that God
punishes his servants when they have recourse to the arm
of man. If the German Reformer had been able to approach
Zwingle at this solemn moment, and pronounce these
oft-repeated words: "Christians fight not with sword and
arquebus, but with sufferings and the cross,"<a name="FNanchor_1229_1229" id="FNanchor_1229_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a> Zwingle
would have stretched out his dying hand, and said, "Amen!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">DAY AFTER THE BATTLE.</div>

<p>Two of the soldiers who were prowling over the field of
battle, having come near the reformer without recognising
him, "Do you wish for a priest to confess yourself?"
asked they. Zwingle, without speaking (for he had not
strength), made signs in the negative. "If you cannot
speak," replied the soldiers, "at least think in thy heart of
the Mother of God, and call upon the saints!" Zwingle again
shook his head, and kept his eyes still fixed on heaven.<a name="FNanchor_1230_1230" id="FNanchor_1230_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a>
Upon this the irritated soldiers began to curse him. "No
doubt," said they, "you are one of the heretics of the
city!" One of them, being curious to know who it was,
stooped down and turned Zwingle's head in the direction of
a fire that had been lighted near the spot.<a name="FNanchor_1231_1231" id="FNanchor_1231_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a> The soldier immediately
let him fall to the ground. "I think," said he, surprised
and amazed, "I think it is Zwingle!" At this moment
Captain Fockinger of Unterwalden, a veteran and a pensioner,
drew near: he had heard the last words of the soldier.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
"Zwingle!" exclaimed he; "that vile heretic Zwingle!
that rascal, that traitor!" Then raising his sword, so long
sold to the stranger, he struck the dying Christian on the
throat, exclaiming in a violent passion, "Die, obstinate
heretic!" Yielding under this last blow, the reformer gave
up the ghost: he was doomed to perish by the sword of a
mercenary. "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death
of his saints." The soldiers ran to other victims. All did
not show the same barbarity. The night was cold; a
thick hoar-frost covered the fields and the bodies of the
dying. The Protestant historian, Bullinger, informs us that
some Waldstettes gently raised the wounded in their arms,
bound up their wounds, and carried them to the fires lighted
on the field of battle. "Ah!" cried they, "why have the
Swiss thus slaughtered one another!"</p>

<p>The main body of the army had remained on the field
of battle near the standards. The soldiers conversed around
the fires, interrupted from time to time by the cries of the
dying. During this time the chiefs assembled in the convent
sent messengers to carry the news of their signal victory
to the confederate cantons, and to the Roman-catholic powers
of Germany.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BARBAROUS OUTRAGE.</div>

<p>At length the day appeared. The Waldstettes spread
over the field of battle, running here and there, stopping, contemplating,
struck with surprise at the sight of their most
formidable enemies stretched lifeless on the plain; but sometimes
also shedding tears as they gazed on corpses which
reminded them of old and sacred ties of friendship. At
length they reached the pear-tree under which Zwingle lay
dead, and an immense crowd collected around it. His countenance
still beamed with expression and with life. "He has
the look," said Bartholomew Stocker of Zug, who had loved
him, "he has the look of a living rather than of a dead man.<a name="FNanchor_1232_1232" id="FNanchor_1232_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a>
Such he was when he kindled the people by the fire of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
eloquence." All eyes were fixed upon the corpse. John
Schönbrunner, formerly canon of Zurich, who had retired to
Zug at the epoch of the Reformation, could not restrain his
tears; "Whatever may have been thy creed," said he, "I
know, Zwingle, that thou hast been a loyal confederate! May
thy soul rest with God!"</p>

<p>But the pensioners of the foreigner, on whom Zwingle had
never ceased to make war, required that the body of the heretic
should be dismembered, and a portion sent to each of the Five
Cantons. "Peace be to the dead! and God alone be their
Judge!" exclaimed the avoyer Golder and the landamman
Thoss of Zug. Cries of fury answered their appeal, and compelled
them to retire. Immediately the drums beat to muster;
the dead body was tried, and it was decreed that it
should be quartered for treason against the Confederation, and
then burnt for heresy. The executioner of Lucerne carried
out the sentence. Flames consumed Zwingle's disjointed
members; the ashes of swine were mingled with his: and a
lawless multitude rushing upon his remains, flung them to the
four winds of heaven.<a name="FNanchor_1233_1233" id="FNanchor_1233_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CONSTERNATION OF ZURICH.</div>

<p>Zwingle was dead. A great light had been extinguished
in the Church of God. Mighty by the Word as were the
other reformers, he had been more so than they in action; but
this very power had been his weakness, and he had fallen
under the weight of his own strength. Zwingle was not
forty-eight years old when he died. If the might of God
always accompanied the might of man, what would he not
have done for the Reformation in Switzerland, and even in the
Empire! But he had wielded an arm that God had forbidden;
the helmet had covered his head, and he had grasped the
halberd. His more devoted friends were themselves astonished,
and exclaimed: "we know not what to say!......a bishop
in arms!"<a name="FNanchor_1234_1234" id="FNanchor_1234_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a> The bolt had furrowed the cloud, the blow had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
reached the reformer, and his body was no more than a handful
of dust in the palm of a soldier.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<div class="sidenote">VIOLENCE OF THE POPULACE.</div>

<p>IX. Frightful darkness hung over Zurich during the night
that followed the afflicting day of Cappel. It was seven in
the evening when the first news of the disaster arrived......Vague
but alarming reports spread at first with the rapidity
of lightning. It was known that a terrible blow had been
inflicted, but not of what kind; but soon a few wounded
men, who arrived from the field of battle, cleared up the
frightful mystery. "Then," said Bullinger, whom we shall
allow to speak, "there arose suddenly a loud and horrible
cry of lamentation and tears, bewailing and groaning." The
consternation was so much the greater that no one had expected
this disaster. "There is not enough for a breakfast,"
had said some haughty worldly men; "With one blow we
shall be masters of the <i>Five Chalets</i>," had said another; and
an old soldier added with disdainful sneer, "We shall soon
have scattered these five dunghills." The christian portion,
convinced that Zurich was fighting in a good cause, had not
doubted that victory would be on the side of truth......Thus
their first stupefaction was succeeded by a violent outburst
of rage. With blind fury the mob accused all their chiefs,
and loaded with insults even those who had defended their
country at the price of their blood. An immense crowd&mdash;agitated,
pale, and bewildered, filled all the streets of the city.
They meet, they question and reply; they question again,
and the answer cannot be heard, for the shouts of the people
interrupted or drowned the voice of the speakers. The
councillors who had remained in Zurich, repaired in haste to
the town-hall. The people, who had already assembled there
in crowds, looked on with threatening eyes. Accusations of
treason burst from every mouth, and the patricians were
pointed out to the general indignation. They must have
victims. "Before going to fight against the enemy on the
frontiers," said the mob, "we should defend ourselves against
those who are within our walls." Sorrow and fear excited the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
minds of all. That savage instinct of the populace, which in
great calamities leads them, like a wild beast, to thirst for
blood, was violently aroused.</p>

<p>A hand from the midst of the crowd points out the council-hall,
and a harsh and piercing voice exclaims: "Let us
chop off the heads of some of the men who sit in these halls,
and let their blood ascend to heaven, to beg for mercy in
behalf of those whom they have slain."</p>

<p>But this fury is nothing in comparison with that which
breaks out against the ministers, against Zwingle, and all
those Christians who were the cause (say they) of the ruin of
the country. Fortunately the sword of the Waldstettes had
withdrawn them from the rage of their fellow-citizens;
nevertheless, there still remained some who could pay for
the others. Leo Juda, whom Zwingle's death was about
to raise to the head of religious affairs, had scarcely recovered
from a serious illness; it is on him they rush. They
threaten, they pursue him; a few worthy citizens carry him
off and hide him in their houses. The rage of these madmen
is not appeased: they continue shouting that atonement
must be made for the slaughter at Cappel, by a still
more frightful slaughter within the very walls of the city.
But God placed a curb in the mouths of these infuriate beasts
of prey, and subdued them.</p>

<p>On a sudden, grief succeeded to rage, and sobs choked
the utterance of the most furious. All those whose relatives
had marched to Cappel, imagine that they are among the
number of the victims. Old men, women, and children, go
forth in the darkness by the glimmering light of torches, with
haggard eyes and hurried steps; and as soon as some wounded
man arrives, they question him with trembling voice about
those whom they are seeking. To some they reply: "I saw
him fall close by my side.&mdash;He was surrounded by so many
enemies," they say to others, "that there was no chance of
safety for him."<a name="FNanchor_1235_1235" id="FNanchor_1235_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a> At these words the distracted family
drop their torches, and fill the air with shrieks and groans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE IS DEAD.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>Anna Zwingle had heard from her house the repeated
discharges of artillery. As wife and mother, she had passed
in expectation many long hours of anguish, offering fervent
prayers to heaven. At length the most terrible accounts,
one after another, burst upon her.</p>

<p>In the midst of those whose cries of despair re-echoed
along the road to Cappel, was Oswald Myconius, who inquired
with anxiety what had become of his friend. Soon
he hears one of the unfortunates who had escaped from the
massacre, relating to those around him that Zwingle had
fallen!<a name="FNanchor_1236_1236" id="FNanchor_1236_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a>.....Zwingle is no more! Zwingle is dead! The
cry is repeated: it runs through Zurich with the rapidity
of lightning, and at length reaches the unhappy widow.
Anna falls on her knees. But the loss of her husband is not
enough: God has inflicted other blows. Messengers following
each other at short intervals announce to her the death
of her son Gerold of Knonau, of her brother the bailiff of
Reinhardt, of her son-in-law Antony Wirz, of John Lustchi
the husband of her dear sister, as well as of all her most
intimate friends. This woman remains alone&mdash;alone with
her God; alone with her young children, who, as they see
her tears, weep also, and throw themselves disconsolate
into their mother's arms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FUNERAL ORATION.</div>

<p>On a sudden the alarm-bell rings. The council, distracted
by the most contrary opinions, has at last resolved
to summon all the citizens towards the Albis. But the
sound of the tocsin re-echoing through the darkness, the lamentable
stories of the wounded, and the distressful groans
of bereaved families, still further increased the tumult. A
numerous and disorderly troop of citizens rushed along
the road to Cappel. Among them is the Valaisan, Thomas
Plater. Here he meets with a man that has but one hand,<a name="FNanchor_1237_1237" id="FNanchor_1237_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a>&mdash;there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
with others who supported their wounded and bleeding
heads with both hands;&mdash;further still is a soldier whose
bowels protrude from his body. In front of these unhappy
creatures peasants are walking with lighted torches, for
the night is very dark. Plater wishes to return; but he
cannot, for sentinels placed on the bridge over the Sihl
allow persons to quit Zurich, but permit no one to reenter.</p>

<p>On the morrow the news of the disgraceful treatment of
Zwingle's corpse aroused all the anger of Zurich; and his
friends, uplifting their tear-bedimmed eyes, exclaimed,
"These men may fall upon his body; they may kindle their
piles, and brand his innocent life......but he lives&mdash;this invincible
hero lives in eternity, and leaves behind him an immortal
monument of glory that no flames can destroy.<a name="FNanchor_1238_1238" id="FNanchor_1238_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a> God,
for whose honour he has labored, even at the price of his
blood, will make his memory eternal." "And I," adds Leo
Juda, "I, upon whom he has heaped so many blessings, will
endeavour, after so many others, to defend his renown and to
extol his virtues." Thus Zurich consecrated to Zwingle a
funeral oration of tears and sighs, of gratitude and cries of
anguish. Never was there a funeral speech more eloquent!</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARMY OF ZURICH.</div>

<p>Zurich rallied her forces. John Steiner had collected on
the Albis some scattered fragments of the army for the
defence of the pass: they bivouacked around their fires on
the summit of the mountain, and all were in disorder. Plater,
benumbed with cold (it is himself who gives us the account),
had drawn off his boots to warm his feet at the watch-fire.
On a sudden an alarm is given, the troop is hastily
drawn up, and, while Plater is getting ready, a trumpeter,
who had escaped from the battle, seizes his halberd. Plater
takes it back, and stations himself in the ranks; before him
stands the trumpeter, without hat or shoes, and armed with a
long pole. Such is the army of Zurich.</p>

<p>The chief captain Lavater rejoined the army at daybreak.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
Gradually the allies came up; 1200 Grisons, under the orders
of the captain-general Frey of Zurich, 1500 Thurgovians,
600 Tockenburgers, and other auxiliaries besides, soon
formed an army of 12,000 men. All, even children, ran
to arms. The council gave orders that these young folks<a name="FNanchor_1239_1239" id="FNanchor_1239_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a>
should be sent back to share in the domestic duties with the
women.</p>

<p>Another reverse erelong augmented the desolation of the
Reformed party. While the troops of Berne, Zurich, Basle,
and Bienne, amounting to 24,000 men, were assembling at
Bremgarten, the Five Cantons intrenched themselves at Baar,
near Zug. But Zwingle was wanting to the Reformed army,
and he would have been the only man capable of inspiring
them with courage. A gust of wind having thrown down
a few fir-trees in the forest where the Zurichers were encamped,
and caused the death of some of their soldiers, they failed
not to see in this the signal for fresh reverses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INACTIVITY OF THE BERNESE.</div>

<p>Nevertheless, Frey called loudly for battle; but the Bernese
commandant Diesbach refused. Upon this the Zurich
captain set off in the night of the 23d October at the head
of 4000 men of Zurich, Schaffhausen, Basle, and St. Gall;
and, while the Bernese were sleeping quietly, he turned the
Waldstettes, drove their outposts beyond the Sihl, and took
his station on the heights that overlook the Goubel. His
imprudent soldiers, believing victory to be certain, proudly
waved their banners, and then sunk into a heavy sleep. The
Waldstettes had observed all. On the 24th October, at two
in the morning, by a bright moonlight, they quitted their camp
in profound silence, leaving their fires burning, and wearing
their white shirts over their dresses that they might recognise
one another in the obscurity. Their watch-word was
"Mary, the mother of God." They glided stealthily into
a pine forest, near which the Reformed troops were encamped.
The men stationed at the advanced guard of the
Zurichers having perceived the enemy, ran up to the fires to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
arouse their friends, but they had scarcely reached the third
fire before the Waldstettes appeared, uttering a frightful
shout.<a name="FNanchor_1240_1240" id="FNanchor_1240_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a> "Har......Har......Har......Har!......Where are these
impious heretics?......Har......Har......Har......Har?"
The army of the cities at first made a vigorous resistance,
and many of the white-shirts fell covered with blood; but this
did not continue long. The bravest, with the valiant Frey
at their head, having bitten the dust, the rout became general,
and 800 men were left on the field of battle.</p>

<p>In the midst of these afflictions the Bernese remained
stubborn and motionless. Francis Kolb, who, notwithstanding
his advanced age, had accompanied the Bernese contingent
as chaplain, reproached in a sermon the negligence and
cowardice of his party. "Your ancestors," said he, "would
have swam across the Rhine, and you&mdash;this little stream
stops you! They went to battle for a word, and you even
the Gospel cannot move. For us it only remains to commit
our cause to God." Many voices were raised against the
imprudent old man, but others took up his defence; and the
captain, Jacques May, being as indignant as the aged chaplain
at the delays of his fellow-citizens, drew his sword, and thrusting
it into the folds of the Bernese banner, pricked the bear
that was represented on it, and cried out in the presence of the
whole army, "You knave, will you not show your claws?"<a name="FNanchor_1241_1241" id="FNanchor_1241_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a>
But the bear remained motionless.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JOY OF THE ROMANISTS.</div>

<p>The whole of the Reformation was compromised. Scarcely
had Ferdinand received intelligence of the death of the
arch-heretic Zwingle, and of the defeat at Cappel, than with
an exclamation of joy, he forwarded these good news to his
brother the Emperor Charles the Fifth. "This is the first
of the victories destined to restore the faith," he had written.
After the defeat at the Goubel, he wrote again, saying that
if the Emperor were not so near at hand, he would not
hesitate, however weak he might be, to rush forward in person,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
sword in hand, to terminate so righteous an enterprise.
"Remember," said he, "that you are the first prince in
Christendom, and that you will never have a better opportunity
of covering yourself with glory. Assist the cantons with
your troops; the German sects will perish, when they are no
longer supported by heretical Switzerland."<a name="FNanchor_1242_1242" id="FNanchor_1242_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a>&mdash;"The more
I reflect," replied Charles, "the more I am pleased with
your advice. The imperial dignity with which I am invested,
the protection that I owe to Christendom and to public
order, in a word, the safety of the house of Austria,&mdash;everything
appeals to me!"</p>

<p>Already about two thousand Italian soldiers, sent by the
Pope and commanded by the Genoese De l'Isola, had unfolded
their seven standards, and united near Zug with the
army of the Five Cantons. Auxiliary troops, diplomatic
negotiations, and even missionaries to convert the heretics,
were not spared. The Bishop of Veroli arrived in Switzerland
in order to bring back the Lutherans to the Roman faith
by means of his friends and of his money.<a name="FNanchor_1243_1243" id="FNanchor_1243_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a> The Roman
politicians hailed the victory at Cappel as the signal of the
restoration of the Papal authority, not only in Switzerland,
but throughout the whole of Christendom.<a name="FNanchor_1244_1244" id="FNanchor_1244_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a> At last this presumptuous
Reformation was about to be repressed. Instead
of the great deliverance of which Zwingle had dreamt, the
imperial eagle let loose by the Papacy was about to pounce on
all Europe, and strangle it in its talons. The cause of liberty
had perished on the Albis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">END OF THE WAR.</div>

<p>But the hopes of the Papists were vain: the cause of the
Gospel, although humbled at this moment, was destined finally
to gain a glorious victory. A cloud may hide the sun for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
time: but the cloud passes and the sun reappears. Jesus
Christ is always the same, and the gates of hell, which triumphed
on the field of Cappel, cannot prevail against his
Church.</p>

<p>Nevertheless everything seemed advancing towards a grand
catastrophe. The Tockenburgers made peace and retired.
The Thurgovians followed them; and next the people of
Gaster. The evangelical army was thus gradually disbanded.
The severity of the season was joined to these dissensions.
Continual storms of wind and rain drove the soldiers
to their homes.</p>

<p>Upon this the Five Cantons with the undisciplined bands
of the Italian general Isola threw themselves on the left bank
of the lake of Zurich. The alarm bell was rung on every
side; the peasants retired in crowds into the city, with their
weeping wives, their frightened children, and their cattle that
filled the air with sullen lowings. A report too was circulated
that the enemy intended laying siege to Zurich. The
country-people in alarm declared that if the city refused to
treat, they would treat on their own account.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RESTORATION OF POPERY.</div>

<p>The peace party prevailed in the council; deputies were
elected to negotiate. "Above all things, preserve the Gospel,
and then our honour, as far as may be possible!" Such
were their instructions. On the 16th November, the deputies
from Zurich arrived in a meadow situated near the
frontier, on the banks of the Sihl, in which the representatives
of the Five Cantons awaited them. They proceeded to the
deliberations. "In the name of the most honourable, holy,
and divine Trinity," began the treaty, "Firstly, we the people
of Zurich bind ourselves and agree to leave our trusty
and well-beloved confederates of the Five Cantons, their well-beloved
co-burghers of the Valais, and all their adherents
lay and ecclesiastic, in their true and indubitable Christian
faith,<a name="FNanchor_1245_1245" id="FNanchor_1245_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a> renouncing all evil intention, tricks, and stratagems.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
And, on our side, we of the Five Cantons agree to leave our
confederates of Zurich and their allies in possession of their
faith."<a name="FNanchor_1246_1246" id="FNanchor_1246_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a> At the same time, Rapperswyl, Gaster, Wesen,
Bremgarten, Mellingen, and the common bailiwicks, were
abandoned to the Five Cantons.</p>

<p>Zurich had preserved its faith; and that was all. The
treaty having been read and approved of, the plenipotentiaries
got off their horses, fell upon their knees, and called
upon the name of God.<a name="FNanchor_1247_1247" id="FNanchor_1247_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a> Then the new captain-general of
the Zurichers, Escher, a hasty and eloquent old man, rising
up, said as he turned towards the Waldstettes: "God be
praised that I can again call you my well-beloved confederates!"
and approaching them, he shook hands successively
with Golder, Hug, Troger, Rychmut, Marquart, Zellger, and
Toss, the terrible victors at Cappel. All eyes were filled
with tears.<a name="FNanchor_1248_1248" id="FNanchor_1248_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a> Each took with trembling hand the bottle suspended
at his side, and offered a draught to one of the chiefs
of the opposite party. Shortly after a similar treaty was concluded
with Berne.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>X. The restoration of Popery immediately commenced in
Switzerland, and Rome showed herself everywhere proud,
exacting, and ambitious.</p>

<p>After the battle of Cappel, the Romish minority at Glaris
had resumed the upperhand. It marched with Schwytz
against Wesen and the district of the Gaster. On the eve
of the invasion, at midnight, twelve deputies came and threw
themselves at the feet of the Schwytzer chiefs, who were
satisfied with confiscating the national banners of these two
districts, with suppressing their tribunals, annulling their
ancient liberties, and condemning some to banishment, and
others to pay a heavy fine. Next the mass, the altars, and
images were everywhere re-established, and exist until the
present day.<a name="FNanchor_1249_1249" id="FNanchor_1249_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a> Such was the pardon of Schwytz!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>
<p>It was especially on Bremgarten, Mellingen, and the free
bailiwicks that the Cantons proposed to inflict a terrible vengeance.
Berne having recalled its army, Mutschli, the
avoyer of Bremgarten, followed Diesbach as far as Arau. In
vain did the former remind the Bernese that it was only according
to the orders of Berne and Zurich that Bremgarten
had blockaded the Five Cantons. "Bend to circumstances,"
replied the general. On this the wretched Mutschli, turning
away from the pitiless Bernese, exclaimed, "The prophet
Jeremiah has well said,&mdash;<i>Cursed be he that trusteth in man!</i>"
The Swiss and Italian bands entered furiously into these
flourishing districts, brandishing their weapons, inflicting
heavy fines on all the inhabitants, compelling the Gospel
ministers to flee, and restoring everywhere at the point of the
sword, mass, idols, and altars.</p>

<p>On the other side of the lake the misfortune was still
greater. On the 18th November, while the Reformed of
Repperschwyl were sleeping peacefully in reliance on the
treaties, an army from Schwytz silently passed the wooden
bridge nearly 2000 feet long which crosses the lake, and was
admitted into the city by the Romish party. On a sudden
the Reformed awoke at the loud pealing of the bells, and the
tumultuous voices of the Catholics: the greater part quitted
the city. One of them, however, by name Michael Wohlgemuth,
barricaded his house, placed arquebuses at every
window, and repelled the attack. The exasperated enemy
brought up some heavy pieces of artillery, besieged this extemporaneous
citadel in regular form, and Wohlgemuth was
soon taken and put to death in the midst of horrible tortures.</p>

<div class="sidenote">&OElig;COLAMPADIUS.</div>

<p>Nowhere had the struggle been more violent than at Soleure:
the two parties were drawn up in battle-array on each
side of the Aar, and the Romanists had already discharged
one ball against the opposite bank, another was about to follow,
when the avoyer Wenge, throwing himself on the mouth
of the cannon, cried out earnestly: "Fellow-citizens, let there
be no bloodshed, or else let me be your first victim!" The
astonished multitude dropped their arms; but seventy Evangelical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
families were obliged to emigrate, and Soleure returned
under the Papal yoke.</p>

<p>The deserted cells of St. Gall, Muri, Einsideln, Wettingen,
Rheinau, St. Catherine, Hermetshwyll and Guadenthall witnessed
the triumphant return of Benedictines, Franciscans,
Dominicans, and all the Romish militia; priests and monks,
intoxicated with their victory, overran country and town, and
prepared for new conquests.</p>

<p>The wind of adversity was blowing with fury: the Evangelical
Churches fell one after another, like the pines in the
forest whose fall before the battle of the Goubel had raised
such gloomy presentiments. The Five Cantons, full of gratitude
to the Virgin, made a solemn pilgrimage to her temple
at Einsideln. The chaplains celebrated anew their mysteries
in this desolated sanctuary; the abbot, who had no monks,
sent a number of youths into Swabia to be trained up in the
rules of the order, and this famous chapel, which Zwingle's
voice had converted into a sanctuary for the Word, became
for Switzerland, what it has remained until this day, the centre
of the power and of the intrigues of the Papacy.</p>

<p>But this was not enough. At the very time that these
flourishing churches were falling to the ground, the Reform
witnessed the extinction of its brightest lights. A blow from
a stone had slain the energetic Zwingle on the field of battle,
and the rebound reached the pacific &OElig;colampadius at Basle,
in the midst of a life that was wholly evangelical. The death
of his friend, the severe judgments with which they pursued
his memory, the terror that had suddenly taken the place
of the hopes he had entertained of the future&mdash;all these sorrows
rent the heart of &OElig;colampadius, and soon his head
and his life inclined sadly to the tomb. "Alas!" cried he,
"that Zwingle, whom I have so long regarded as my right
arm, has fallen under the blows of cruel enemies!"<a name="FNanchor_1250_1250" id="FNanchor_1250_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a> He
recovered, however, sufficient energy to defend the memory
of his brother. "It was not," said he, "on the heads of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
most guilty that the wrath of Pilate and the tower of Siloam
fell. The judgment began in the house of God; our presumption
has been punished; let our trust be placed now on
the Lord alone, and this will be an inestimable gain." &OElig;colampadius
declined the call of Zurich to take the place of
Zwingle. "My post is here," said he, as he looked at Basle.</p>

<p>He was not destined to hold it long. Illness fell upon
him in addition to so many afflictions; the plague was in
the city; a violent inflammation attacked him,<a name="FNanchor_1251_1251" id="FNanchor_1251_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a> and erelong
a tranquil scene succeeded the tumult of Cappel. A peaceful
death calmed the agitated hearts of the faithful, and replaced
by sweet, tranquil, and heavenly emotions, the terror
and distress with which a terrible disaster had filled them.</p>

<p>On hearing of the danger of &OElig;colampadius, all the city
was plunged into mourning; a crowd of men of every age
and of every rank rushed to his house. "Rejoice," said the
reformer with a meek look, "I am going to a place of everlasting
joy." He then commemorated the death of our Lord
with his wife, his relations, and domestics, who shed floods
of tears. "This supper," said the dying man, "is a sign of
my real faith in Jesus Christ my Redeemer."</p>

<p>On the morrow he sent for his colleagues: "My brethren,"
said he, "the Lord is there; he calls me away. Oh! my
brethren, what a black cloud is appearing on the horizon&mdash;what
a tempest is approaching! Be steadfast: the Lord will
preserve his own." He then held out his hand, and all these
faithful ministers, clasped it with veneration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF &OElig;COLAMPADIUS.</div>

<p>On the 23d November, he called his children around him,
the eldest of whom was barely three years old. "Eusebius,
Irene, Alethea," said he to them, as he took their little hands,
"love God who is your Father." Their mother having promised
for them, the children retired with the blessing of the
dying servant of God. The night that followed this scene was
his last. All the pastors were around his bed: "What is the
news?" asked &OElig;colampadius of a friend who came in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
"Nothing," was the reply. "Well," said the faithful disciple
of Jesus, "I will tell you something new." His friends
awaited in astonishment. "In a short time I shall be with
the Lord Jesus." One of his friends now asking him if he
was incommoded by the light, he replied, putting his hand on
his heart: "There is light enough here." The day began
to break; he repeated in a feeble voice the 51st Psalm:
<i>Have mercy upon me, O Lord, according to thy loving kindness</i>.
Then remaining silent, as if he wished to recover strength,
he said, "Lord Jesus, help me!" The ten pastors fell on
their knees around his bed with uplifted hands; at this moment
the sun rose, and darted his earliest rays on a scene of
sorrow so great and so afflicting with which the Church of
God was again stricken.<a name="FNanchor_1252_1252" id="FNanchor_1252_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a></p>

<p>The death of this servant of the Lord was like his life,
full of light and peace. &OElig;colampadius was in an especial
degree the Christian spiritualist and biblical divine. The
importance he attached to the study of the books of the Old
Testament imprinted one of its most essential characters on
the reformed theology.<a name="FNanchor_1253_1253" id="FNanchor_1253_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a> Considered as a man of action, his
moderation and meekness placed him in the second rank.
Had he been able to exert more of this peaceful spirit over
Zwingle, great misfortunes perhaps might have been avoided.
But like all men of meek disposition, his peaceful character
yielded too much to the energetic will of the minister of Zurich;
and he thus renounced, in part at least, the legitimate
influence that he might have exercised over the reformer of
Switzerland and of the Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY BULLINGER.</div>

<p>Zwingle and &OElig;colampadius had fallen. There was a
great void and great sorrow in the Church of Christ. Dissensions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
disappeared before these two tombs, and nothing
could be seen but tears. Luther himself was moved. On
receiving the news of these two deaths, he called to mind
the days he had passed with Zwingle and &OElig;colampadius at
Marburg; and the blow inflicted on him by their sudden decease
was such, that many years after he said to Bullinger:
"Their death filled me with such intense sorrow, that I was
near dying myself."<a name="FNanchor_1254_1254" id="FNanchor_1254_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a></p>

<p>The youthful Henry Bullinger, threatened with the scaffold,
had been compelled to flee from Bremgarten, his native
town, with his aged father, his colleagues, and sixty of the
principal inhabitants, who abandoned their houses to the pillage
of the Waldstettes.<a name="FNanchor_1255_1255" id="FNanchor_1255_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a> Three days after this, he was
preaching in the cathedral of Zurich: "No! Zwingle is not
dead!" exclaimed Myconius; "or, like the ph&oelig;nix, he has
risen again from his ashes." Bullinger was unanimously
chosen to succeed the great reformer. He adopted Zwingle's
orphan children, Wilhelm, Regula, and Ulric, and endeavoured
to supply the place of their father. This young man,
scarcely twenty-eight years of age, and who presided forty
years with wisdom and blessing over this church, was everywhere
greeted as the apostle of Switzerland.<a name="FNanchor_1256_1256" id="FNanchor_1256_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CONTRITION OF ZURICH.</div>

<p>Yet as the sea roars long after the violent tempest has
subsided, so the people of Zurich were still in commotion.
Many were agitated from on high. They came to themselves;
they acknowledged their error; the weapons of their warfare
had been carnal; they were now of a contrite and humble
spirit; they arose and went to their Father and confessed
their sin. In those days there was a great mourning in
Zurich. Some, however, stood up with pride, protested by
the mouth of their ministers against the work of the diplomatists,
and boldly stigmatized the shameful compact. "If the
shepherds sleep, the dogs must bark," exclaimed Leo Juda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
in the cathedral of Zurich. "My duty is to give warning
of the evil they are about to do to my Master's house."<a name="FNanchor_1257_1257" id="FNanchor_1257_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a></p>

<p>Nothing could equal the sorrow of this city, except the exultation
of the Waldstettes. The noise of drums and fifes,
the firing of guns, the ringing of bells, had long resounded
on the banks of their lakes, and even to their highest valleys.
Now the noise was less, but the effect greater. The Five
Cantons, in close alliance with Friburg and Soleure, formed
a perpetual league for the defence of the ancient christian
faith with the Bishop of Sion and the tithings of the Valais;
and henceforward carried their measures in the federal affairs
with boldness. But a deep conviction was formed at that
period in the hearts of the Swiss Reformed. "Faith comes
from God," said they; "its fortune does not depend on the life
or death of a man. Let our adversaries boast of our ruin, we
will boast only in the Cross."<a name="FNanchor_1258_1258" id="FNanchor_1258_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a> "God reigns," wrote Berne
to Zurich, "and he will not permit the bark to founder."
This conviction was of more avail than the victory of Cappel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONCLUSION.</div>

<p>Thus the Reformation, that had deviated from the right
path, was driven back by the very violence of the blow into
its primitive course, having no other power than the Word of
God. An inconceivable infatuation had taken possession of
the friends of the Bible. They had forgotten that our warfare
is not carnal; and they had appealed to arms and to
battle. But God reigns: he punishes the churches and the
people who turn aside from his ways. We have thus taken
a few stones, and piled them as a monument on the battle-field
of Cappel, in order to remind the Church of the great
lesson which this terrible catastrophe teaches. As we bid
farewell to this sad scene, we inscribe on these monumental
stones, on the one side, these words from God's Book:
"<i>Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember

the other, this declaration of the Head of the Church: "<i>My
kingdom is not of this world.</i>" If, from the ashes of the
martyrs at Cappel, a voice could be heard, it would be these
very words of the Bible that these noble confessors would
address, after three centuries, to the Christians of our days.
That the Church has no other king than Jesus Christ; that
she ought not to meddle with the policy of the world, derive
from it her inspiration, and call for its swords, its prisons, its
treasures; that she will conquer by the spiritual powers
which God has deposited in her bosom, and, above all, by
the reign of her adorable Head; that she must not expect
upon earth thrones and mortal triumphs; but that her march
is like that of her King, from the manger to the cross, and
from the cross to the crown:&mdash;such is the lesson to be read
on the blood-stained page that has crept into our simple and
evangelical narrative.<a name="FNanchor_1259_1259" id="FNanchor_1259_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1259_1259" class="fnanchor"></a></p>

<p>But if God teaches his people great lessons, he also gives
them great deliverances. The bolt had fallen from heaven.
The Reformation seemed to be no more than a lifeless body
cumbering the ground, and whose dissevered limbs were
about to be reduced to ashes. But God raises up the dead.
New and more glorious destinies were awaiting the Gospel of
Jesus Christ at the foot of the Alps. At the south-western
extremity of Switzerland, in a great valley which the white
giant of the mountains points out from afar; on the banks of
the Leman lake, at the spot where the Rhone, clear and blue
as the sky above it, rolls its majestic waters; on a small hill
that the foot of Cæsar had once trod, and on which the steps
of another conqueror, of a Gaul, of a Picardine<a name="FNanchor_1260_1260" id="FNanchor_1260_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a> were destined
ere long to leave their ineffaceable and glorious traces,
stood an ancient city, as yet covered with the dense shadows
of Popery; but which God was about to raise to be a beacon
to the Church, and a bulwark to Christendom.</p>

<h4>HORNE'S INTRODUCTION.</h4>

<p class="hanging">An Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures.
By Thomas Hartwell Horne, B.D. New Edition, corrected
and enlarged. Illustrated with numerous Maps and Fac-similes of
Biblical Manuscripts. 2 vols. imperial 8vo. Price only $3 50.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Mr. Carter has issued an edition of Horne's Introduction, which he offers at the
astonishingly low price of $3 50&mdash;for the two volumes! Truly the scholar's millenium
has well nigh come. Those who have paid twenty dollars for it, in four volumes,
will hardly understand by what process such a massive work can be so cheaply
furnished. It is a reprint from the last London edition, with Dr. Horne's latest
additions and corrections, containing all the maps and illustrative engravings.</p>

<p>"To commend Horne's Introduction to the clergy or other students of the sacred
oracles, would be 'carrying coals to Newcastle.' It has long been regarded as an
indispensable work for a theological library, and has acquired among Biblical scholars&mdash;at
least English scholars&mdash;a deservedly high repute. It is a work of gigantic
labour. The results of the research and erudition of Biblical scholars of all countries,
and in all time, are faithfully garnered, and, on the whole, well digested."&mdash;<i>N.Y. Evangelist.</i></p></blockquote>

St. George's Church, New-York. 1 vol. 8vo. Price $1 00.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The fair sheet on which they are printed, with its wide margin and handsome
type, attracts and pleases the eye; while the Scripture truth and holy sentiment
which glow through their transparent style, delight and improve the heart. The
subjects are all of an eminently spiritual character, relating to the new birth, and
the sanctification of the soul. They are treated with no effort for the display of
talent, but with a manifest and most earnest desire to do good. The diction is polished
and slightly embellished, ranging between the neat and elegant; the method is
always clear, and the argument cogent."&mdash;<i>Recorder.</i></p></blockquote>

Society. 4 vols. 12mo. Price only $2 00.</p>

<blockquote><p>"This history is not a servile copy from any other, but has a delightful freshness
about it, the borrowed parts being re-written, and cast into a new form, on such
principles of selection and arrangement, as favour perspicuity, and assist the memory.
Instead of being lost in a chaos of materials, the reader is carried along in a
plain path through well assorted and happily adjusted facts, cheered by a vivacity
which keeps him interested. God is not excluded from the world which he created,
nor is his interposition in the affairs of men overlooked. For common use we think
it deserves to supersede all that have gone before it."&mdash;<i>Portland Christ. Mirror.</i></p></blockquote>

generation, Dr. Chalmers is unquestionably the strongest. It will gratify many that
so able a writer, and so just a Theologian, has given the world an analysis of this
Epistle. It is written in the terse and manly style of the author, but with no inflation

<blockquote><p>"The reputation of Dr. Chalmers stands high&mdash;too high to be affected by the
opinions of ordinary men. As a literary man and a man of science&mdash;as a Christian
and a Theologian&mdash;as a profound thinker and powerful writer&mdash;as an expositor of
fundamental truth in Divinity and philosophy, and a practical man in the various

certain it is that they unite both in a very uncommon degree. Cecil was one of the
most gifted and heavenly-minded men of which the Church of England, or any other
church, can boast; and though his mind was peculiarly constituted, the highest and
the lowest are alike sensible of the charm that belongs to his productions, and of
the power that dwells in them. His writings possess the attribute of being remarkably
suggestive&mdash;a single half page will often supply materials for long-continued
meditation."&mdash;<i>Citizen.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"This work is well executed, and is, we think, calculated to become popular. The
historical plan is clear and unique, and the style is singularly attractive, on account
of its purity and strength. It is constructed upon a Christian basis, recognizing the
fact, that although the superintending power of God over the progress of nations,
may be as untraceable as his paths in the ocean, yet the effects are everywhere visible,
and manifest the progressive fulfilment of the prophetic denunciations and promises
set forth in the Holy Oracles."&mdash;<i>Protestant Churchman.</i></p></blockquote>

London Edition.</p>

<blockquote><p>"This book is an exhortation to Christians, and Christian ministers, to exercise
greater faithfulness in saving souls from eternal death. We have read it with much
pleasure, and we hope with some profit. The book is most beautifully got up; and
we could wish that it might be read and pondered by every one who indulges a hope
that he is a Christian."&mdash;<i>N. Y. Evangelist.</i></p></blockquote>

New Edition.</p>

<blockquote><p>"This will relieve the catechism of a difficulty which many have felt in respect to it&mdash;that
it is too abstract to be comprehended by the mind of a child; here every truth
is seen in its practical relations, and becomes associated in the mind with some interesting
fact which is fitted at once to make it plain to the understanding, to lodge it in
the memory, and to impress it upon the heart."&mdash;<i>Daily Advertiser.</i></p></blockquote>


<h4>MEMOIR OF JOHN D. LOCKWOOD.</h4>

<p class="center">Being Reminiscences of a Son by his Father.</p>

<blockquote><p>"A gifted mind and cultivated powers, hallowed and controlled by a sweet and
trustful piety; the simplicity of childhood mingled with the seriousness and discretion
of mature age,&mdash;we are sure no one could watch his brief career, terminating in
a death, though sudden, not unprepared for, without deep interest. We have read
it with unmingled pleasure and profit."&mdash;<i>N. Y. Evangelist.</i></p></blockquote>

author of this volume. Happily, though dead, he yet speaks in a tone of impressive
and earnest admonition; and the present volume particularly, is a witness
to the fidelity and zeal with which he discharged his ministerial duties. The subjects
of which it treats are of the deepest moment; and the manner in which he treats
them is worthy of the tenderness and fidelity of an ambassador of Christ. The work
is admirably adapted to promote a revival of religion."</p></blockquote>
